Ten years later "the band" had a reunion. Cody and Dr. Dumas are living comfortably in the ZON. They chose to be in their mid thirties, raising two kids, and living on a ranch in Wyoming in a valley nestled in the Grand Tetons. They also participate in other virtual realities, but for them, their home is in Wyoming.

Grace Roseberg is the Secretary General of the UN and living on Mars. She is expanding living capacity on Mars at a reasonable pace that is environmentally responsible. A big reason Grace is so successful is her adoption of steam power. The Earth never did "turn itself around." Polar ice melting continues to accelerate, resulting in the seas rising faster than forecasters had predicted. Miami Beach, Key West, the Upper Keys and Lower Keys are all underwater. The U.S., South East and the Gulf Coast are suffering from high sea levels.

Hurricanes are increasing in frequency and intensity. Florida insurance premiums have forced the average person out of southern Florida. The only people living south of Disney World are the ultra rich who have built environmental fortresses on the receding coastlines and squatters who are living in abandoned homes. The Villages, a premier retirement settlement in Florida grew to over 100,000 dwellings. Today it is habitable from November to February. It is an area with no utilities, no police force and no owners. Devastating hurricanes from 2030 to 2050 convinced the Federal Government to condemn it and buy it out. It is completely uninsurable and utilities refuse to make repairs. But still every year from November to February, thousands of squatters make their way to The Villages and ride around in golf carts and play pickleball on deserted tennis courts.

Scotty Armstrong is still being Scotty. He has made and lost three fortunes over the last ten years. He is happy and unfazed by both his fortune and misfortune. He takes work and adventure as it comes his way. He never looks for it because he knows trouble and adventure will always find him. His one constant is his feelings for Sally Cross who he visits whenever he can.

Sally Cross is still on RFS-3. She owns a couple of huge warehouses connected to RFS-3. It is a must see tourist trap on the way to Mars. She replicated part of Ft Worth, TX Cowtown Colosseum complete with a rodeo featuring both virtual rodeos in the ZON and mechanical rodeos featuring exoskeletal bulls. She is very wealthy now but hasn't slowed down much. She still enjoys when Scotty drops in.

Captain Russell is still flying but he is now based on the Moon. Most of his flights these days are from Earth to the Moon and back to Earth. This is usually a one week trip including a one day layover to load the Spacecraft. He actually docks at one of the International Space Stations. That is where the tanker is usually loaded. It only takes him about 4 hours to fly to Earth and get to his house. He then usually gets seven to ten days off to spend with his family. It is working out very nicely for him. He gets back to Mars once every two or three years. That is usually at the direction or request of the BIG Three (Dr. Dumas, Betty or Grace). They are very sensitive missions that no one so far talks about. Betty certainly hasn't told me about them. I guess that is for another day.

Norman is now a captain of his own tanker ship and was married but now divorced from Betty. They share one child. Betty and her daughter Cassiopeia, who they call Cass live on Mars. Norman runs mostly a legitimate business except of course when Scotty or Sally ask him for a favor.

Betty is now an executive producer at GNN. She currently lives on Mars with her daughter, Cass. They rarely return to Earth. I get on ZON and talk to them. Cass especially likes it when I put on a concert as Big Daddy Phil. We go into a reality on the ZON that has 250,000 attentive fans. I get to play my songs for hours. It is really an ego boost for me and Cass has a lot of fun there with her friends. Many times she will accompany me on her ukelele. 

The narrator:  Since it is 2065, I am eleven years past my termination date of 100. I am technically dead on Earth, but I know a guy, several as a matter of fact, who were able to place my brain in a rack on the Moon. I am having much more fun now in virtual worlds. I will have them unplug me at some point in time, but it will not be this day. Big Daddy Phil has many more stories to tell.
