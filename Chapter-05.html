<b><center><font size="+1">The rise of the Hydro</font></center></b>
Betty does a special report for GNN about why cryptocurrencies are now worthless. The Hydro coin, an actual coin made of promethium and gold, is the only currency that holds value.


<b><center><font size="+1">GNN Special Report:
The end of cryptocurrencies and the rise of the Hydro Coin</font></center></b>
In a world once abuzz with the promise of digital fortunes, the cryptocurrency bubble has burst, leaving a trail of disillusioned investors and a stark reality: cryptocurrencies, once hailed as the future of finance, are now virtually worthless. This special report will delve into the factors that led to the downfall of cryptocurrencies and examine the rise of Hydro Coin, a tangible asset-backed currency poised to redefine the financial landscape.

The Cryptocurrency Mirage: The allure of cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, lay in their promise of decentralized, secure, and transparent financial transactions. However, this promise was built on a foundation of speculation and hype, rather than intrinsic value. Unlike traditional currencies, which are backed by tangible assets like gold or government guarantees, cryptocurrencies derived their value solely from market sentiment and the belief that their prices would continue to rise.

This speculative nature led to an unsustainable bubble, where prices skyrocketed to astronomical levels, far exceeding any underlying value. Investors, driven by the fear of missing out, poured their money into these digital assets, refueling further price increases. However, as the bubble reached its peak, reality began to set in.


<b><center><font size="+1">The bubble bursts</font></center></b>
In 2017, the cryptocurrency market reached its zenith, with Bitcoin's value surpassing $20,000. However, the bubble soon began to deflate, as investors realized the inherent risks of these speculative assets. The lack of regulation, susceptibility to manipulation, and security breaches further eroded confidence in cryptocurrencies.

As prices plummeted, the illusion of cryptocurrencies as a reliable store of value crumbled. Investors who had rushed to buy in at inflated prices watched helplessly as their investments dwindled to near insignificance. Bitcoin, the once-celebrated champion of the cryptocurrency revolution, lost over 90% of its value, trading at a fraction of its peak.


<b><center><font size="+1">The rise of the Hydro Coin:
A tangible currency for a digital age</font></center></b>
Amidst the cryptocurrency wreckage, a new paradigm has emerged: Hydro Coin, a physical coin backed by a reserve of tangible assets, including gold, silver, and platinum. This intrinsic value provides Hydro Coin with a stability and resilience that eluded its digital counterparts.

The Hydro uses a capital <font size="+1"> <b>(H)</b></font> for its symbol along with the more traditional dollar sign <font size="+1"><b>($)</b></font>. This is to set it apart from other currencies and to address its Hy-space origins and their use of Hydrogen fuel.

<img src="Spacer.gif" width="70" height="1" alt=""><img src="Chapter05-b1.gif" width="161" height="150" alt="">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="Chapter05-b2.gif" width="66" height="150" alt="">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="Chapter05-b3.gif" width="151" height="150" alt="">

Investors, weary of the volatility and uncertainty of cryptocurrencies, have flocked to Hydro Coin, seeking a safe haven for their assets. The coin's physical form and tangible backing offer a sense of security that digital currencies could never provide.


<b><center><font size="+1">A new era of financial stability</font></center></b>
The rise of Hydro Coin marks a turning point in the evolution of finance. It demonstrates that a decentralized currency can coexist with traditional assets, providing a secure and stable alternative to the volatile world of cryptocurrencies.

Hydro Coin's success could pave the way for a new era of financial stability, where individuals have greater control over their finances and are not subject to the whims of traditional banks and financial institutions. The coin's intrinsic value and physical form offer a level of security that digital currencies could never match, providing investors with peace of mind and a renewed sense of trust in the world of finance.

As the world grapples with the aftermath of the cryptocurrency bubble, Hydro Coin stands as a beacon of hope, offering a glimpse into a future where finance is decentralized, secure, and backed by tangible assets. The coin's emergence signals a paradigm shift in the financial landscape, one that prioritizes stability and value over speculation and hype.

Betty does another report on why it is so easy to mine cryptocurrency with today's (2050) technology and this has led to its decline.


<b><center><font size="+1">Cryptocurrency mining in the age of quantum computing:
A double-edged sword</font></center></b>
In the year 2050, the world of cryptocurrency mining has undergone a radical transformation, driven by the advent of quantum computing. Quantum computers, with their unparalleled computational prowess, have made it significantly easier to mine cryptocurrencies, particularly those based on proof-of-work (PoW) algorithms. This newfound ease of mining, while initially promising, has also contributed to a significant decline in the value of many cryptocurrencies.

The ease of mining with quantum computers stems from their ability to perform calculations that are exponentially faster than classical computers. This enhanced efficiency has drastically reduced the time and energy required to solve the complex mathematical problems involved in PoW mining. As a result, individuals and organizations can now mine cryptocurrencies with unprecedented speed and efficiency.

While this enhanced mining capability might seem beneficial, it has inadvertently led to a decline in the value of many cryptocurrencies. With more people able to participate in mining, the supply of these digital assets has increased dramatically, outpacing demand and driving down prices. This oversupply has created a downward spiral, as the declining value of cryptocurrencies further incentivizes more mining, further exacerbating the supply-demand imbalance.

The impact of quantum computing on cryptocurrency mining extends beyond mere price fluctuations. The increased ease of mining has also raised concerns about the security of cryptocurrency networks. Quantum computers could potentially be used to attack the underlying blockchain technology, disrupting the integrity of the network. This heightened security risk has further eroded investor confidence in cryptocurrencies.

In response to these challenges, the cryptocurrency community has begun exploring alternative consensus mechanisms, such as proof-of-stake (PoS), that do not rely on energy-intensive mining processes. PoS algorithms instead prioritize those who stake their cryptocurrencies, rewarding them for their contribution to the network's security and stability.

The transition to PoS algorithms, however, is not without its challenges. Implementing these new consensus mechanisms requires significant technical expertise and coordination among network participants. Additionally, the long-term viability of PoS algorithms remains to be tested, as they have not been as widely adopted as proof of work (PoW) algorithms.

Despite these challenges, the cryptocurrency community is actively exploring solutions to address the issues raised by quantum computing and the ease of mining. The development of new consensus mechanisms, coupled with advancements in cybersecurity measures, could potentially revitalize the cryptocurrency landscape and restore investor confidence.

In conclusion, the advent of quantum computing has fundamentally altered the cryptocurrency mining landscape. While it has made mining easier and more accessible, it has also introduced new security challenges and contributed to the decline of many cryptocurrencies. As the cryptocurrency community grapples with these challenges, the evolution of quantum computing technology will undoubtedly continue to shape the future of digital currencies.


<b><center><font size="+1">Hy-Space lab in NY HQ blows up</font></center></b>
Two weeks later, the regularly scheduled broadcast of the Price is Right, hosted by Bob Barker IV, was interrupted by Urgent Update. The Hy-Space Lab in NY had just blown up. There were casualties and surrounding hospitals were told to prepare for a mass casualty event. More would be made known when the situation became more clear. 

The 44th Triad came together at their favorite bar in Houston when they heard of the explosion at Hy-Space headquarters. They were all hopeful that Dr. Dumas survived, but they feared the worst. The 44th Triad had a lot in common beyond trying to bring down Marcus. Yes, their connection to Dr. Dumas went much further than that. Captain Russel, Scotty Armstrong, Sally Cross, Cody Jacobs and Norman had all been helped by Dr. Dumas' expertise. They all had been wounded in combat and had limb-loss. As they were starting their fourth round of drinks and again saluting the good Doctor they started recounting just how Dr. Dumas had assisted them.

Captain Russell received a new left leg from the knee down. His leg was shattered by shrapnel and had to be removed.

Scotty lost his fingers and most of his right hand during his ordeal evading the Russians after he was shot down. What a bullet didn't destroy, frostbite did.

Sally lost an eye. It was her left one, the brown one. Sally had one brown and one blue eye. That is what got Scotty's immediate attention when he first met her. Sally always thought it made her look like a freak. Scotty told her that it was what made her so beautiful. So when Dr. Dumas gave her the choice of color for her eye replacement she chose brown just for Scotty.

Cody had both feet blown off when he was pulling a wounded buddy out of the line of fire of a sniper. Norman lost his right arm, from the shoulder down, during a crash in combat.

Dr. Dumas had worked on all of them and they always appreciated her work. Also they would be the first to be called by Dr. Dumas whenever her team made a breakthrough that could help one of them. Can you imagine how overwhelmed they were when Betty called Captain Russell and told him Dr. Dumas was still alive. Betty also told Captain Russell that Dr. Dumas and she were in grave danger. Betty told Captain Russell about her last conversation with Dr. Dumas and asked for his help in getting to Mars. He assured her that he could make that happen. He told her not to trust anyone and always verify her upcoming contacts by asking them to show her their coin.  

On the nightly news, more information was revealed about the explosion. The news anchor relayed the following information. There has been an explosion at Hy-Space headquarters and tragically, renowned neuro-scientist Dr. Dumas was critically injured and has second and third degree burns over more than sixty percent of her body. There were also twenty fatalities and several others injured. They were being taken to local hospitals. 

A cold chill went up Bettys spine. She had to act on the information Sophia gave her. If Sophia wasn't already dead, she soon would be.

Betty went to her safe and pulled out the small brown envelope Sophia had given her. The contents were a key and an address. It read, 425 N Broadway, Jericho, NY.

Jericho was about 30 miles outside New York City. Since time was of the essence, she got her drone and headed out towards Jericho. She went south on the FDR and crossed the Williamsburg bridge. Betty was pushing it and made good time. She was able to navigate the 25 miles in about twenty minutes on her new Hy-Drone XSI4. It would have taken about 90 minutes by car.

Betty pulled up to 425 N Broadway, Jericho, NY. It was a post office. Then Betty knew the key was to a numbered lock box inside. Betty walked inside, looked at the key which had 147 stamped on the side and went to lock box 147 and opened it. It contained a burner phone, a card, H$300,000 cash and a shiny 44th Triad token.

Betty put the money in her purse. Luckily she was carrying her large purse and put the burner phone in her jacket pocket. She went out and sat in her drone and read the card. It said;


<center><img src="Chapter05-c.gif" width="500" height="245" alt=""></center>
Fifteen minutes later the burner phone rang. It was a video call. The person said, "Who are you?" Betty answered, "My name is Betty Ballena, I am an at large reporter for GNN." The person said, "Place your eyes in position so I can do a retina scan for verification." The person said, "verified, check into the Meadowbrook Motor Lodge under the name of Ms. Beluga and wait for me."

Betty said, "Who are you, and how will I identify you?" The voice said, "I am First Sergeant Cody Jacobs. The code words are, 'REDDER PASTURES' your response will be, 'HOPEFULLY'. If you answer correctly, I will help you, if not, you are on your own. Wait patiently, I will be there as quickly as I can."

Cody arrives at the Meadowbrook Motor Lodge and knocks on Betty's door. Cody says, "Open the door just a crack with the chain still on. Now show me your coin." Betty takes out her 44th Triad coin and shows it to Cody. Cody then says, "Redder Pastures" and Betty replies, "Hopefully." Betty feels assured and lets him in her room. 

Together they pull up chairs, sit at a small desk and read the notes that Betty has received from Dr. Dumas. They read in the notes that Sophia expected some kind of attack on her and wanted to put the following plan in place.

Sophia had developed a brain computer interface BCI and functioning actuators for brain to neural exoskeleton interfaces (BNEI). She also had developed a viable transport mechanism to keep the brain functioning.

In layman's terms, Sophia provided us with the following instructions.

Secure the box (transport mechanism)

Take my brain out of my body and put it into the box

Get another brain and put it into my body

Send my brain and Betty to the Moon

Work with Scotty to get both of us to the Moon

On the Moon have my brain inserted into station SH1-43770

Contact Norman who is Scotty's friend and smuggle Betty onto a tanker ship to Mars where she will hide out in an unused future population container next to an abandoned landing pad.


<b><center><font size="+1">Betty escapes Earth to the Moon.</font></center></b>
Betty had a high level source within Hy-Space. She had been able to monitor Sophia's status. Sophia had been put into a medically induced coma as part of her pain management. Sophia has been in this state for six weeks and was actually showing positive signs of recovery. She would never fully recover but with the help of an exoskeleton she would probably be able to function.

Betty's source told her that senior leaders in Hy-Space were openly talking about terminating Sophia. She was too high a risk to the company. Hy-Space stock would nose dive if Sophia survived to disclose what she knew. Betty's source told her that Marcus was not just talking about firing and discrediting Sophia. Marcus actually wanted her dead.

For Betty and Cody this was not unexpected. In a way, it was a good thing and actually made Sophia's plan easier to justify and live with.

From Betty's source she learned that Hy-Space was going to have a press conference stating Dr. Dumas needed an emergency procedure to alleviate swelling of the brain that has resulted from her tragic accident. The procedure was going to take place in a couple of days.

Betty and Cody highly suspected that Sophia would never survive this procedure. Betty's source was actually in charge of the Hy-Space medical team that was to perform this procedure. Betty told her source about Sophia's plan and was assured that her team would help as far as they could.

So far, Sophia's plan was working. The Hy-Space medical team did their part. From the results of the Hy-Space official press release the news reported that, "With great sadness, Hy-Space regrets to announce that Dr. Dumas did not survive her medical procedure. The whole Hy-Space family is deeply saddened by this news."

GNN wrote an accurate but rather sterile obituary about Dr. Dumas following Hy-Space's announcement that Dr. Dumas had died as the result of injuries she suffered from the explosion. They mostly detailed her career as a neurosurgeon and her work with the wounded soldiers.


<b><center><font size="+1">GNN obituary</font></center></b>
Dr. Sophia Dumas, renowned neurosurgeon and advocate for wounded soldiers, died yesterday.

They were correct when stating that she grew up in St. Paul, MO and that she was a pioneering neurosurgeon and tireless advocate for wounded soldiers.

Dr. Dumas was a leading expert in the field of neurosurgery, and her work had a profound impact on the lives of countless patients. She was also a passionate advocate for wounded soldiers, and she worked tirelessly to improve their care and quality of life.

Dr. Dumas was a gifted surgeon, and she was known for her innovative techniques and her compassionate bedside manner. She was a pioneer in the use of minimally invasive surgical techniques, and she was also a leading researcher in the field of traumatic brain injury.

In addition to her work as a surgeon, Dr. Dumas was also a passionate advocate for wounded soldiers. Dr. Dumas was a true pioneer in the field of neurosurgery. She was a brilliant surgeon and a compassionate caregiver. She will be deeply missed by all who knew her.

They went on to list more accomplishments and awards of which there were many. Cody Jacobs read the obit and just wasn't satisfied with it. It was totally accurate but Cody thought she deserved more. So he wrote his own and sent it out to known friends of Dr. Dumas. 


<b><center><font size="+1">Cody Jacobs personal obituary for Sophie Dumas</font></center></b>
Dr. Sophia Dumas was a woman of French Canadian descent, with features that reflected her heritage. She had a warm, engaging smile that crinkled the corners of her hazel eyes, and her laughter was as refreshing as a mountain stream. Her face was framed by a cascade of long, dark hair, usually pulled back into a loose braid that danced with her every move. Her skin was smooth and fair, with a hint of rosy color that deepened when she was animated. Her figure was slender and graceful, and she carried herself with an air of quiet confidence that was both captivating and reassuring.

Sophia's French Canadian ancestry was evident in her sharp cheekbones, high-bridged nose, and slightly pointed chin. Her eyes were a deep hazel, flecked with gold, and they sparkled with intelligence and curiosity. Her lips were full and naturally rosy, and she often wore a hint of color, adding a touch of femininity to her strong, determined features.

Her style was understated and elegant, reflecting her practical nature and her focus on her work. She favored tailored suits in neutral tones, often paired with crisp white blouses and simple jewelry. Her shoes were always polished, and her hair was always neatly styled, but there was never anything fussy or pretentious about her appearance.

Sophia was a woman of substance, and her beauty was more than skin deep. She was brilliant, compassionate, and fiercely dedicated to her work. Her outward appearance was simply a reflection of her inner strength and grace.

Cody loved her deeply and thought that this is how he would always remember his beloved Sophia Dumas. She was his neighbor, best friend and love of his life and he would never forget her. 

That same day, word came down from Marcus himself that he wanted Sophia's body cremated immediately and wanted a memorial service set up within the week. What the public didn't know nor did anyone else outside the Hy-Space medical team, was that the body of Dr. Dumas that was cremated did not contain her brain. Her brain was inserted into a transport mechanism designed by Dr. Dumas herself.

The transport mechanism was placed in a janitor's closet down the hall and around the corner from the exit of the operating room where Dr. Dumas' brain was removed. That was the last known location that anyone on Earth would ever know.

Thirty minutes after Sophia's brain was placed in the janitors closet, Betty dressed in janitors clothes, that included a gray hoodie and dark glasses, picked up "the box", put it in a trunk marked Hy-Space janitorial service and wheeled it to the freight elevator and took it down to parking garage P2. Cody jumped out of the black SUV and helped load "the box" into the back.

Cody immediately drove to Teterboro Space Port where they met up with Scotty. Teterboro Space Port was known as a quick launch port. It didn't have capabilities to go to the Moon but it was great at ferrying small craft to Earth's upper atmosphere. Scotty had a small craft that would be ferried to near space and from there it would be released and had enough power to go to one of the orbiting space stations. Two days later Scotty acquired a ship (paid for with Betty's cash). Three days later they landed on the Moon.

<img src="Chapter05-d.gif" width="540" height="265" alt="" border="2">

Scott Armstrong (Scotty) is very good at what he does. Besides being an exceptional pilot he is even better at what he calls being a discreet privateer. So in very quick order he acquired lodging on the Moon for an indefinite period of time for Betty. He gave the box to a Hy-Space operative that he convinced was one piece of the last shipment that had been delayed, along with signed instructions of where to place it in the "rack."

Betty's quarters were very small but manageable. It looked like just another small container from the outside, that was inside a warehouse containing thousands of containers. On the inside it was efficient, containing a bed, a small desk, bathroom, a sink and small refrigerator.

It also had four large trunks on wheels sitting in the corner. Betty was a trained, experienced reporter; but she didn't need any of that experience to presume that these trunks were important, and secondly, Scotty had probably put them there.

Scotty showed up a couple of times to update Betty on her status. Scotty was making a deal with some guy named Norman who was going to get her to Mars and, oh yeah, he needed another H$100k to make things go smoothly. Betty pointed to the four trunks and asked Scotty what they contained.

Scotty explained that trunk one contained all of Dr. Dumas' notes and her computer. Trunk two was a combination of first aid supplies, medical supplies and personal hygiene products that Betty wouldn't have access to for a while when she was hiding out on Mars. Trunk three held a radiation/space suit, helmet and oxygen bottles. Trunk four had clothes. Granted they were mostly jumpsuits, t-shirts, yoga pants, socks and underwear but she knew she wasn't going anywhere fancy for quite a while. Scotty explained to Betty that these were her go bags. When the time came, she was to take these four trunks and go to the designated spot by bay 9.

The next day, Scotty arrived early, he immediately said, "It's go time, let's get your trunks together and go to Mars." Betty asked, "That's it, I am going to Mars today?"

Scotty said, "Did I stutter? I told you I would set this up. Now let's get going, we can't be late." So at ten minutes past the hour, Betty found herself and her four trunks at bay 9 waiting for some guy named Norman.

Norman was set. He had done this over a hundred times. Now was the time to load the special cargo. Loading was all about the timing. It was like a timed choreographed dance.

At exactly twelve minutes past the hour, he would fully open the warehouse door marked bay 9. That is where the ship was docked. When the doors were fully open they blocked the cameras. The guards were also making other security checks.  He then had six minutes to get the first container out of the warehouse and inside the ship. He pressed the button and the doors started to open right on time. Three more feet and he would be ready to go. The problem was that the doors stopped moving. He couldn't believe it. He immediately started his breathing exercises and repeated his "chant" to remain calm. It's going to be ok. It was a process he learned from the doctors in reform school as part of his anger management training. "Serenity now!" That was the chant he was taught… take deep breaths and repeat, "Serenity Now! Serenity Now!" This would always bring back to mind his pet Narwhal and how it would thrash back and forth with his big tusk, which in actuality was nothing more than an overgrown tooth, in his aquarium.

As always, he did calm down. He collected himself and walked out of the warehouse door and looked behind it to see why it was stuck. There they were. Four large travel trunks were keeping the door from opening. Knowing he was on camera, he calmly picked up each of the four, one hundred pound trunks and moved them the twelve feet needed to clear the door.

Then he went back inside the warehouse and waited. At forty two minutes past the hour, he could start the process over from the beginning. Hit the button, doors open and again the doors stop. Calmly he walked around the door. Not only were the travel trunks back where they started, but a woman was also standing next to them. Betty had moved the trunks back to where she had positioned them earlier.  "Hi, I'm Betty," she said to Norman.

Norman looks at Betty and says that Scotty had done an excellent job. He was referring to how Betty looked. She had boots on that made her look four inches taller. Several layers of clothes made her look heavy. She was wearing a stocking cap that had some padding in it that kind of made her look like a cone-head. She also had odd makeup on that had stealth angles. To top it off she was wearing gloves that were oversized and Scotty had even put clear tape at odd angles across her face. To put it bluntly, she looked like a big ugly lumberjack. Norman threw two duffle bags toward her that looked full but were obviously filled with something light, like paper or styrofoam. He told her to throw them over her shoulders and load them onto the tanker. Then Norman went back into the warehouse and got a big case on wheels that he pushed onto the tanker ship. Five minutes later, a big heavy set, weird looking guy who looked like an ugly lumberjack walked out of the bay door of the tanker ship and went back into the warehouse. To the cameras on the dock, it looked like Norman and some big guy loaded four medium size cases and a large case and the helper went back into the warehouse. The tanker ship bay doors closed, it disconnected from the dock and left.

As you can guess, Scotty was in the bigger case. Norman loaded the bigger case with Scotty inside onto the tanker ship. Scotty got out of the case once he was safely on board and switched outer clothing with Betty. Scotty then had on the same boots, pants, oversized coat and weird hat that the cameras had recorded. Betty got into the big case which was going to serve as her temporary quarters for a little while until Norman and Captain Russell figured out what to do with her.

Captain Russell had an oversized safety pod installed on his ship a while ago. It was originally built in case of a radiation storm, asteroid shower or some other potential catastrophe. Lately he had been using it as his mancave. This is where Betty stayed until they made it to Refueling Station 3. Once they arrived at RFS-3, Sally Cross came on board and met with Betty. Betty also got to take a hot shower on RFS-3. Sally also had a full service spa, some apartments and a warehouse. Betty got her hair cut very short and had it dyed black. Sally set her up in typical work clothes. She always wore dark glasses and a beret. Even her own mother wouldn't recognize her if she saw her on the street. Unfortunately they could only stay on RFS-3 for three days, if they wanted to stay on schedule, and not draw any attention to the flight. 

Captain Russell, Betty, and Sally Cross have one last meeting to catch up on 44th Triad business and say their goodbyes. Betty also leaves a copy of all of the material that Dr. Dumas had given her. They all figured it would be secure in Sally's warehouse on the off chance that Betty gets caught on Mars. Betty, Captain Russell, and Norman get back on the tanker ship and continue on their journey. Nothing eventful happens over the next two months. They make their scheduled stops at RFS-4 and RFS-5 right on schedule. About twenty-five days out from Mars, Captain Russell receives word that the Space Force has been tipped off that he has a stowaway that he is planning to smuggle into Mars. 

Captain Russell contacts Scotty who sets up a rendezvous about ten days out from Mars. Right on schedule, Scotty shows up in one of his faster, smaller crafts and docks with the tanker ship. Captain Russell offloads Betty and her four trunks and the small craft and tanker ship go separate ways. 


<b><center><font size="+1">Pandora shows her worth</font></center></b> 
On this particular mission, the tanker ship is tethered to a rather large cargo ship. Captain Russell is to take the cargo ship to the outer Mars atmosphere and release it. The cargo ship will make a soft landing and exoskeletons will then configure it as temporary quarters for Mars immigrants from Earth. The cargo ship has provisions for twenty for six months, plus it is carrying greenhouse tents and water and oxygen generators. Pandora is able to intercept the flight path of this unmanned cargo ship and direct it to land near the abandoned launch pad where Betty is going to stay for a while. The cargo ship and the brain-controlled exoskeletons complete their mission and set up Betty in comfortable quarters for over a year. 

Betty was safe and secure but It was very nerve wracking for her to get through the last couple of weeks. Betty had almost been caught by the Space Force when they conducted a surprise immigration inspection of Captain Russell's ship (which Captain Russell was fully aware was going to happen) as it entered into Mars' orbit. Someone had tipped off the Space Force that Captain Russell's ship had illegal contraband onboard. Captain Russell invited a contingent from the Space Force to search his ship saying he had nothing to hide. They also wanted to know about the contents of the tethered cargo ship that they were towing. Captain Russell assured the Space Force that no life forms were on the tethered cargo ship. Its purpose was to be released into the Mars atmosphere, safely land on Mars in the manufacturing sector and await for Exoskeletons to receive their orders to incorporate the hull of the cargo ship and its contents into its designated space. The Space Force inspected the main latches and confirmed that they had been sealed on Earth, and inspected the manifest accompanying the cargo ship. Captain Russell also invited them to scan the cargo ship for life forms. 

Norman did not even blink at this search because he knew that Scotty had already picked up Betty and her four trunks earlier before the Space Force had boarded their ship. Norman then dumped waste from their ship into Mars' gravitational belt, Scotty with his small ship and precious cargo simply floated into Mars atmosphere and appeared to be space debris falling onto a remote part of Mars. 

Betty was starting to settle in. She felt relatively safe in the manufacturing region where she was living in a converted cargo ship. She had all the provisions that she needed for now and access to ZON. ZON was the nickname for the Moon Earth Mars Exoskeleton Network (MEMEXON). This is the neural network and exoskeleton interface and avatar virtual reality network that allows brains in racks on the Moon to be networked to the exoskeletal worker bees on Mars.

Dr. Dumas was "alive, not thriving in ZON." ZON was her baby, she invented it as part of her work with the wounded soldiers of the 2044 war. Marcus Mephitis had his people bastardize it and use it to build his empire on Mars, but no one understood it the way she did. Now that everyone thought she was dead, and since she had no other distractions, she was able to nurture her baby and grow it into so much more than what anyone knew about. 
 
She allotted a certain portion to the Hy-Space pukes who were secretly going about building a playground for the rich, but ZON was now so much more than that. Dr. Dumas first established communication with Betty and through Dr. Dumas' direction enabled Betty to set up not only communications but a manufacturing facility in her pod. Dr. Dumas carved out a virtual reality secure space where she and Betty would meet and talk as avatars. The next thing that Dr. Dumas did was establish the ability for her to be a hologram in Betty's space. She more or less moved in with her. They became close friends. 


<b><center><font size="+1">Dr. Dumas as an android</font></center></b>
Finally Scotty was able to "find" a sophisticated 3-D printer that met Dr. Dumas' specifications and he had it delivered through Norman's skullduggery. Norman and Betty had become quite close during her stay on Mars. He was her lifeline to the rest of the world and the supplier of almost anything that Betty asked for.

Norman actually set up the 3-D printer and attached it to ZON. He was also able to deliver the raw materials Dr. Dumas requested. He was able to acquire aluminum, fiber optic cable, titanium, carbon fiber, acrylic resin and thermoplastics in the quantities that Dr. Dumas requested. The 3-D printer slowly and meticulously started printing by combining all of these materials. It took about a week and during that time Betty and Norman would check on the printer and make sure it was being fed the proper raw materials. Finally it finished. What Betty and Norman saw was a replica of Dr. Dumas. It was as good a figure as you would see in a museum that had wax figurines.

Dr. Dumas, with Norman and Bettys help, hooks the figure to ZON. Within 24 hours an exact replica of Dr. Dumas was walking and talking to Betty and Norman. The replica was being controlled by Dr. Dumas' brain that was in the rack on the Moon. Dr. Dumas had reinvented herself as the first android that was controlled by a living brain.

Dr. Dumas' first 48 hours as an android with a human brain attached through a neural network were a whirlwind of new experiences and sensations.

At first, she was overwhelmed by the constant input from her new artificial senses. She could see in 360 degrees, hear the slightest whisper, and feel the most delicate textures. It took her some time to adjust to this new level of awareness.

She also had to learn how to control her new body. It was much stronger and faster than her human body, but it was also more difficult to coordinate. She had to practice walking, running, and climbing before she could move around comfortably.

Despite the challenges, Dr. Dumas was fascinated by her new existence. She loved being able to explore Mars with her new senses and abilities. She also enjoyed the feeling of being connected to the Martian hive mind. She could access and share information with others in the ZON instantly.

During her first 48 hours, Dr. Dumas also had the sense that she was completely alone. There was no other quite like her. She did have a greater sense of freedom however because she could adjust her appearance. Height, weight, hair and eye color, and even the shape of her face could all be changed within certain parameters. She had to deal with the actual material that made up her body. So she could be an inch or two taller or shorter but certainly not change her height in feet. 

Dr. Dumas also spent time exploring the Martian landscape. She visited the Valles Marineris, the largest canyon system in the solar system. She also climbed Mount Olympus Mons, the tallest mountain in the solar system.

Dr. Dumas was amazed by the beauty and diversity of Mars. She felt privileged to be able to experience it firsthand.

At the end of her first 48 hours, Dr. Dumas was exhausted but exhilarated. She had embarked on a new and exciting chapter in her life. She was eager to see what the future held for her as an android on Mars. 


<b><center><font size="+1">Marcus steals the Mona Lisa</font></center></b>
Marcus Mephitis was never satisfied. He also wanted more. He would take on any challenge just for the thrill of it. That is what got him into this situation. He was talking to his clientele of luxury condo owners on Mars. They were discussing the lax laws on Mars and how it was the perfect place to bring stolen antiquities and priceless art pieces. This was because on Mars possession was the law for artifacts that weren't obtained on Mars. You obviously couldn't steal a person's drone or food or space suit and get away with it. There were rules and laws for that. But there were no laws for artifacts obtained on another planet. The judicial system was too new and there was no case law to cover such things. That is when one of Marcus' clients said, if you can get me the Mona Lisa, I don't care how you do it, I will pay you 5 billion Hydros. 

Marcus thought, I will take that challenge and set about making a plan to steal the Mona Lisa and nine other works of art from the Louvre and ship them to Mars on a luxury cruiser. 

He put together the following plan:


<center><b><font size="+1">Gaining inside information
</font></b></center>
Marcus bribed a museum employee named Jean-Pierre to give him inside information about the Louver's security system and the movements of the artworks. Jean-Pierre told Marcus that the Louver's security system was outdated and that there were several weaknesses that could be exploited. He also told Marcus that the Mona Lisa and nine other works of art were scheduled to be moved to a new exhibit the following night.


<center><font size="+1"><b>Disabling the security system
</b></font></center>
On the night of the heist, Marcus and his team of thieves infiltrated the Louvre through a maintenance hatch. They then used Jean-Pierre's inside information to disable the security system. They hacked into the system and cut the power to the security cameras.


<center><font size="+1"><b>Stealing the artworks</b></font></center>

Once the security system was disabled, Marcus and his team were able to steal the Mona Lisa and nine other works of art. They carefully removed the artworks from their frames and carried them out of the museum.


<center><font size="+1"><b>Transporting the artworks to the cruiser
</b></font></center>
Marcus and his team transported the artworks to the luxury cruiser in a specially designed van. The van was equipped with a climate-controlled compartment to protect the artworks from damage.


<center><font size="+1"><b>Shipping the artworks to Mars
</b></font></center>
Marcus and his team loaded the artworks onto the luxury cruiser and prepared to ship them to Mars. The cruiser was equipped with a state-of-the-art security system to protect the artworks during the journey. Marcus' plan was audacious and risky, but it was also successful to a point. He was able to steal the Mona Lisa and nine other works of art from the Louvre and successfully put them on a cruiser bound for Mars. He thought he had committed the perfect crime until he didn't.
	

<b><center><font size="+1">44th Triad make plans to get it back</font></center></b>
Betty had been informed by her sources at Interpol that the Mona Lisa had been stolen from the Louvre. She couldn't figure out why she hadn't heard about it on the news until she was told that at the request of the French Government there was to be a news blackout on the theft until more was known about how and why it happened. 

Betty's sources at Interpol confirmed her suspicions. Marcus was behind the theft of the Mona Lisa from the Louvre. He planned to smuggle the painting to Mars on one of his luxury cruisers.

Betty called a meeting of the 44th Triad to discuss how to retrieve the painting. Captain Russell explained the risks involved. He also told the Triad that he was confident that he could verify which cruiser the painting would be on and locate where it would be hidden on the ship.

Scotty said that with that information, he was confident that he could board the cruiser and retrieve the painting. The Triad agreed to Captain Russell and Scotty's plan. They gave them all the resources they needed to carry it out.

Captain Russell and Scotty used their connections to find out which cruiser the Mona Lisa would be on and where it would be hidden on the ship. They then developed a plan to board the cruiser and retrieve the painting.

Scotty and Captain Russell's plan to retrieve the stolen art was based on misdirection, deception and confusion. Scotty assembled a fleet of junk drones disguised as attack privateer ships. These were to be used to make the cruiser's crew believe that their ship was under attack. The drones were deliberately slow and tended to travel in straight lines to make them easy targets for the cruiser's defenses.  While the cruiser crew was distracted, Scotty would be able to sneak up behind them and dock at the opposite side of the cruiser. Scotty would then board the cruiser and retrieve the stolen art. He would be able to do this because of the distraction caused by the attack. Once Scotty had the art, he would return to his ship and escape. The cruiser crew would never realize that they had been tricked.

The retrieved art would then be turned over to Betty who in turn quietly returns the stolen art to Interpol. The art would then be verified and returned to the Louvre Museum.

Here is a more detailed account of how the fake attack actually went:

Scotty's original plan was to intercept the luxury cruiser, Genesis 1, at a refueling station. Sally convinced Scotty to intercept the luxury cruiser, about five miles out from the refueling station. This would allow Scotty to take advantage of the fact that the luxury cruiser would be slowing down and going through docking checklists. In other words, more of the crew would be busy with mundane tasks.  

Scotty's fleet of junk drones approached the cruiser from multiple directions. The drones were equipped with flashing lights and sirens to make them look more convincing. The cruiser crew was initially confused by the appearance of the drones. They had never seen anything like them before. As the drones got closer, the cruiser crew began to fire on them. Some of the drones were purposely slow and tended to travel in straight or predictable courses. The crew members all cheered as they easily blew up the first wave of drones. The second wave was more difficult than the first. During the second wave, Scotty pulled alongside the other side of the ship and docked. This was undetected because a couple of well aimed shots knocked out some of the ships sensors, particularly the ones on the same side that Scotty had docked on. 

The third wave was even more elusive and harder to attack. They actually got off some well placed shots that did superficial damage to the cruiser. Some antennas were destroyed as well as some furring strips. Nothing that would compromise the integrity of the haul. The third wave was the most critical to the retrieval operation. This is when Scotty was actually onboard the cruiser. The third wave did its part in keeping all available crew members occupied. The Mona Lisa is not a large painting. It is 30 inches by 21 inches. The other nine paintings were also similar in size. Some slightly larger and some slightly smaller. All ten of them fit easily into a forty by forty hardshell packing case. The packing case was on rollers. Scotty simply rolled it out to the docking station, put it back on the cargo bay of his small ship and flew away. The cruiser crew never realized that they had been tricked. They continued to fire on the drones until they disappeared into hyperspace. Captain Russell and Scotty's plan was a success. They were able to retrieve the stolen art without anyone being hurt.


<b><center><font size="+1">Fake privateers recover the Mona Lisa.</font></center></b>
The next morning GNN started their Urgent Update of the incredible bravery of Hy-Space's brave crew that successfully fought off a host of attacking privateers that were attempting to commandeer the luxury cruiser and hold the passengers as hostages. They had live interviews of crew men and women who actually were involved in the battle. They interviewed the captain and some of the passengers who made the battle much bigger than it actually was. Finally they even interviewed Marcus who gave a long monologue about how his cruisers were the best and safest ships in space today. Never once was any mention made of the Mona Lisa and the stolen property that was on board the cruiser. 

The French Government announced that the Mona Lisa was back on display. It had been taken down for some routine inspection and maintenance. The French Government never did admit that its security had been compromised. Marcus was furious when he learned that the Mona Lisa had been stolen from his cruiser. He put a bounty of one million Hydros for information leading to the capture of the privateers that attacked his cruiser. He never did have any idea that it was all planned and executed by Captain Russell and Scotty.

<b><center><font size="+1">Scotty's other business</font></center></b>
Scotty was one of the first to put the theory of Lubin to practical use. Lubin's idea was to attach a small probe to a solar sail, orbit a laser array, and push the probe toward its destination at speeds far in excess of anything we can attain these days. Lubin estimates a probe weighing only a few hundred pounds could be accelerated to Mars using this method in just three days. Scale the technology up from unmanned probes to manned vessels (no mean feat), and we could be talking about a journey to Mars in a month, one-fifth of the travel time via conventional techniques.


Philip Lubin's theory <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/general/deep-in-directed-energy-propulsion-for-interstellar-exploration/" target="_blank"><img src="Flag.Waving.gif" width="14" height="14" title="..... energy propulsion for-interstellar exploration" alt=""></a>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5HgF9JOHSU" target="_blank"><img src="YouTube.gif" width="50" height="12" title="..... Phillip Lubin's lecture on Directed Energy Propulsion" alt=""></a> on space travel is based on the use of directed energy propulsion (DEP). DEP uses high-power lasers or microwaves to propel spacecraft to relativistic speeds. This would allow spacecraft to travel to distant stars and planets in a fraction of the time it would take using traditional propulsion methods.

<b>Lubin's theory is based on the following principles:</b>

<b>Momentum transfer:</b> When a photon strikes an object, it transfers momentum to that object. This momentum transfer can be used to propel the object.

<b>Relativity:</b> At relativistic speeds, the mass of an object increases. This means that a small amount of momentum transfer can result in a large increase in velocity.

<b>Directed energy:</b> By focusing the energy of a laser or microwave beam on a spacecraft, it is possible to transfer a large amount of momentum to the spacecraft in a short amount of time.

Lubin has proposed several different DEP systems for spacecraft propulsion. One system uses a laser to vaporize a propellant on the spacecraft. The vaporizing propellant then creates a thrust that propels the spacecraft forward. Another system uses a microwave beam to heat a propellant on the spacecraft. The heated propellant then expands and creates a thrust that propels the spacecraft forward.

Lubin's theory is still in the early stages of development, but it has the potential to revolutionize space travel. If DEP can be made practical, it would allow us to travel to other stars and planets in a matter of years or even months.

<b>Here is a simplified example of how Lubin's theory could be used to propel a spacecraft:</b>

A laser or microwave beam is focused on a spacecraft.

The beam vaporizes or heats a propellant on the spacecraft.

The vaporizing or expanding propellant creates a thrust that propels the spacecraft forward.

The spacecraft accelerates to relativistic speeds.

Once the spacecraft has reached relativistic speeds, it can travel to distant stars and planets in a fraction of the time it would take using traditional propulsion methods.

Lubin's theory has the potential to make space travel more accessible and affordable. It could also lead to new discoveries and opportunities for exploration.

Since Scotty will only take passengers from the ISS, he bypassed many political restrictions and doesn't have to worry about all the fuel necessary to exit the Earth's atmosphere. Plus he is known to be extremely discreet and also tends to not follow rules and regulations.

He has been rumored to deal in black market contraband to bring eccentric billionaires on Mars whatever they request.


<b><center><font size="+1">Scotty's crafts</font></center></b>
<img src="Chapter05-f.gif" width="540" height="265" alt="" border="2">

Scott Armstrong had six to ten serviceable craft depending who he owed, who he pissed off and who needed him the most. The smallest and fastest was designated as SA-Lubin 1. It could carry himself and two passengers and enough cargo and food to sustain him and his passengers for the five days necessary to get from one of the ISSs to Mars. The five day trip was only possible with the correct alignment of the planets and assuming there are no large solar flares or asteroids in the way. In short, the conditions needed to be perfect for a five day trip. But even under non-perfect conditions Scotty was able to make the trip in ten to twenty days which was still far faster than anything else going to Mars. 

While it was not common for people to come up with the 1 million Hydros to take such a flight, Scotty has had over a dozen passengers since he started providing this service after the Drone War ended in 2046. More common was the passenger who missed the launch of a scheduled luxury cruiser and needed to catch up with their party. An individual could miss the launch by three weeks and still catch up at Refueling Station 2 in a day or two with time to spare.

Scotty had four cargo ships that were primarily used to shuttle products and goods to refueling stations. These were not as large as the Hy-Space tankers that brought cargo to Mars. These were much faster though. They were the equivalent to the bicycle messenger guys who delivered small but urgent goods and services across town in a very quick and discreet manner. A typical customer would be a person on a luxury cruiser to Mars who forgot to pack their medicine or they decided they just couldn't live on Mars without their pet Ashera cat. Scotty would only be too happy to fly the medicine or cat or anything else to a Refueling station so it would be there when a customer arrived weeks or months later on a much slower luxury cruiser. According to Mars colony rules, no pets are allowed in the colony compound because they are viewed as a waste of critical resources. They take up precious oxygen, water and food that is needed for humans. They are screened upon arrival of the luxury cruisers by Space Force authorities. So of course Scotty has figured out a way to smuggle almost anything into Mars, for a premium fee of course. 

 The largest, SA-Lubin 10, was a combination craft that could transport a dozen passengers and their cargo from an ISS to Mars in a month.  The price for a trip of that nature was two million Hydros per person. Although the price more than covered the cost of the flight, what the passengers were really paying for was discretion and anonymity. Scotty's flights were not registered and had no customs checks. Of course they couldn't land at Mars Space Port 1 but Scotty had enough connections to get his passengers to where they needed to go.
