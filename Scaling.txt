To change the scaling on a Windows PC, you can: 

Open Display settings by selecting Start > Settings > System > Display 

Scroll down to Scale and layout 

Select an option from the drop-down menu under Change the size of text, apps, and other items 

(The Recommended option is usually the best choice)

You can also choose Custom scaling to set a percentage between 100% and 500% 

Click Apply to save changes

Changing the scaling can affect the size of text, apps, and other items on the screen. Some programs 
and features may not work well with larger scaling sizes.

You can also change the screen resolution by using the drop-down menu under Display resolution. Changing the resolution can cause content to appear pixelated or blurry.
