Aggrement was reached to have each web page have a toggle-styled "Go/Exit Fullscreen" button at the top of the page. 


2.  Synopsis - (Bruce's task)

Have the "About" button pop-up synopsis for each web page reflect the synopses in each of the synopses web pages.


3.  Headers and Spacing on all web pages - (Bruce's task)

Have each header be "Centered", high-lighted in Bold with a font="+2" and preceeded by two (2) Blank Lines and followed by 
one (1) Blank Line.


4.  Flags-References (Gary's task)

Place a "flag" (with a reference link) by each article within the web pages that require a reference to an external source.
