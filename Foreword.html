Happy New Year, January 1, 2050.  

Well here I am. Ninety-six years old. I not only have to decide what I want to do today but also who I want to be and how I want to exist today. 

Not like the old days when I got up, brushed my teeth and hair. Went to the bathroom, put on clean socks and underwear. Picked out a shirt and changed my blue jeans once a month. Now those were the good old days. Speaking of the good old days, I have had many. I grew up in the sixties and raised a family through the seventies, eighties and nineties. I watched my kids go away to college and really never return home.

I have dental implants, a good heart with clean veins and new valves, a full head of reddish blonde hair, excellent eyesight and all major joints replaced. So here is the morning routine of a 96 year old in 2050.

My first step is to head to the bathroom, where a sleek, AI-powered mirror awaits me. The mirror scans my body, providing a real-time health assessment and identifying any potential issues. It even offers personalized skincare recommendations, ensuring that my complexion remains as youthful as my spirit.

After freshening up, I make my way to the kitchen, where I have chosen to have my voice service to be Michelle Obama. The great thing about the AI voice service these days is that it not only sounds like the named person it also thinks like that person. The AI service has stored all of the president's decisions all the way back to Washington. So you not only get the voice replicated but also the  daily decisions of the person is built into the response. Today Michelle has prepared a nutritious breakfast tailored to my dietary needs. With breakfast out of the way, I embark on my daily exercise routine. My smart home gym adjusted itself to my current fitness level, providing personalized guidance and motivation. 

Once my workout is complete, I spend some time catching up on the latest news and developments in various fields. I still watch the Price is Right from 10:00 to 11:00.  

As the day draws to a close, I find myself relaxing in my living room, surrounded by the calming ambiance created by my smart home system. I reflect on the remarkable day I had just experienced, grateful for the opportunities and advancements that had allowed me to live life to the fullest at 96 years old.

My morning routine was a glimpse into the future, where age was no longer a barrier to living a vibrant and fulfilling life. Technology has transformed aging, providing individuals with the tools and resources to maintain their health, vitality, and independence well into their later years. Big Daddy Phil was a living testament to this transformation, an embodiment of the adage that age is just a number.
  
I finally retired in 2017 and was starting to really enjoy the planned travel when Covid-19 hit and pretty much shut everything down in March of 2020. My wife got tired of me just sitting around the house and pestering her, so one day she showed me an article about a luthiery in rural Missouri who made guitars. She suggested that I contact him and have him make me one. Then she suggested that I learn to play it. I did both of those things. I became a singer-songwriter.

At the age of 72 in 2026 I went on the road as Big Daddy Phil. I was in the right time and the right place with my music. Starting around 2024 and for the next twenty years or so, there was a great demand for simple folk music. Sure AI could write perfect songs in a matter of minutes and synthesizers could interpret that work and spit out any song with any instrument in a couple of more minutes.  But there became a big demand for artists playing instruments and writing their own songs. It was all part of the next generation rebelling against and rejecting the status quo that their parents had passed down to them. I was a novelty and cashed in on it. With my imperfect voice and storytelling cadence I had a very successful music career that lasted until 2044, when Russia invaded Norway and changed everything.  

So here I am, part of the last generation to die and possibly the last generation to live. For the last generation to die, it was a political decision, globally. No one can stay alive past 100. There simply aren't enough resources on the planet to support such a population. Ten billion is currently the magic number. That is the current global population cap that the global economic leaders have capped for sustainability. In 1950 the global population was 2.5 billion. It has grown by 7.5 billion over the last hundred years.

Between vaccinations and medical advances, dying these days is mostly a choice. There are those who still don't believe in vaccines and some of them die from the various pandemics, but medical advancements have quickly found cures to treat most of those. So that quickly sums up the last generation to die.

The last generation to live is really complicated and will be determined by the outcome of these intertwined actions.

2050 has arrived. For Earth the climate has been affected just as predicted but on the high side of the predictions. The seas have risen twelve to eighteen inches in various parts of the world. High tides, hurricanes and El Ni&ntilde;o have made many areas uninhabitable. One hundred and fifty million people have been displaced by the rising seas. Countless others have been displaced from the expansion of deserts.

Bangkok, Amsterdam, Ho Chi Minh City, Cardiff UK, New Orleans, Manila, London, Shenzhen China, Hamburg and Dubai all have had parts of their cities inundated by sea waters. Yet the powers that be insist that this is an anomaly, that the seas will retreat in a few years. This has been fueled by pure economics. Companies still don't want to spend the money to reduce the carbon footprint. So in 2050, millions have been displaced because of rising seas, millions more because of expanding and new deserts. Because of this, the major nations have pushed a UN resolution to put a cap on the population and figure out a Plan B in case things get worse.

But enough about me and the past. I took it upon myself to chronicle the adventures of my great-granddaughter. She always wanted to be a writer and reporter and that is what she went to school for. She became famous, very successful, and was quite the figure on world stages. She operated on Earth at first but then moved onto the Earth's Moon and eventually to Mars.  

Now she has quite a story. That is what I plan on conveying to you. My great-granddaughter's name is Betty, Betty Ballena, and she is an investigative reporter for Global News Network (GNN). Betty played a major part in reporting on and being involved with the rise and fall of industrial mogul and multibillionaire Marcus Mephitis. Betty, her friends and associates put their lives at stake to make Earth and Mars a better place.
