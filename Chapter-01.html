<center><b><font face="arial" size="+1">Status of Earth</font></b></center>
To really appreciate the importance of what they accomplished you need to have an understanding of just who Marcus Mephitis was, who he was perceived to be and who he turned into. During the 2040s, Marcus Mephitis had been perceived as the "world savior." Marcus is a multibillion dollar industrialist who is vastly profiting off of the world's problems. He is part of the "temporary problem group." 

The "temporary problem group," believes that Earth is just going through a cycle. They say that Earth's climate has gone through many changes in its history, Sandy Eldredge and Bob Biek authored a paper in 2010 called <a href="https://geology.utah.gov/map-pub/survey-notes/glad-you-asked/ice-ages-what-are-they-and-what-causes-them/" target="_blank"><img src="Flag.Waving.gif" width="14" height="14" alt="" title=".....Utah Geological Survey"></a> "Glad You Asked:  Ice Ages - What are they and what causes them?" The original article was updated in 2019, and included additional resource links. It does not address pre- and post-Industrial Revolution climate change. It is true that the Earth has gone through at least five major ice ages throughout its history. These things happen over tens or even hundreds of thousands of years. They also caused species extinctions. So unless people are comfortable going the way of the dinosaurs, they must realize that humans with their actions are threatening the very existence of their species. 

Marcus' base premise has made him a fortune building, selling and repairing drones as a personal means of transportation. Your streets are flooded, no problem, fly through the streets in a drone. Cities don't have money to hold back the oceans, no problem, buy a drone and get above it all. By and large this drone transportation has succeeded remarkably well. Street maintenance has gone by the wayside, flood buyouts have ceased so cities and insurance companies have all adopted the "don't fix it, fly over it" philosophy. Most coastal cities around the globe have overwhelmingly accepted Personal Drones (PDs) as the primary mode of transportation.

Marcus is also covering his bets with his space program. Hy-Space is now the largest transporter of goods and services to the Moon and Mars. Starting with his Spaceport in New Zealand he has forged a multibillion dollar business out of betting that humans will not be able to survive on Earth and therefore must have alternate outposts on both Earth's Moon and Mars. 

The majority of his "world savior" reputation was attained during the 2044 war involving the Russian invasion of Norway. His combination of advanced weaponry attached to the frame of drones and the reliance on and interaction with the human pilots and commanders took away the advantage for China and its allies. This eliminated China's control over military hardware that it sold to other countries. It also eliminated embedded backdoor access that China previously had over the AI hardware and software.


<b><center><font size="+1">Marcus wanted Mars to become the new
Queenstown, New Zealand</font></center></b>
For years starting in the 1960s Queenstown, New Zealand has been referred to as the Doomsday capital of the world. In 2023, Queenstown had almost 48,000 residents. Of the households there, twenty-five percent are unoccupied. New Zealand does not track foreign home ownership nor do they classify Doomsday houses, so there is no public record of how many exist. There are approximately 20,000 private dwellings in the Queenstown area and about 5,000 are unoccupied. It's rumored that over a thousand of those dwellings are Doomsday dwellings.

Doomsday dwellings are exactly what they sound like. They typically contain sealed bunkers that contain an environment capable of maintaining life for a small group of people for months. They are basically insurance policies against nuclear war, pandemics, civil unrest and other garden variety catastrophes.

Maintenance of these are very expensive so they are owned by the super rich. Not only are the physical compounds expensive to maintain but so are the climate crisis and protecting the planet.

The emergency session is attended by representatives from all 193 UN member states. The delegates hear from a panel of experts who provide scientific evidence of the planet's deteriorating health. The experts also discuss the associated networks. The lucky few who are designated to go to a bunker must be tracked, collected and transported to the bunker. This will typically happen during a global crisis or at least a regional one, so collecting and transporting these individuals is no small task.

Now look at the logistical issues of replicating that on Mars. For starters the physical compounds/bunkers will be exponentially more expensive. Secondly the collection and transportation of the individuals will not only be expensive but also will be fraught with political and logistical problems. Also travel time will be highly competitive.


<b><center><font size="+1">UN plans to colonize Mars</font></center></b>
In 2034 the UN gathered for an emergency session to address the status of Earth and its fitness to support life. The UN Secretary-General convenes an emergency session of the General Assembly to address the status of Earth and its fitness to support life now and in the future. In his opening remarks, the Secretary-General paints a grim picture of the planet's health. He cites the following alarming trends:

Rising global temperatures

Increasing extreme weather events

Declining biodiversity

Pollution of air, water, and soil

The Secretary-General warns that these trends are putting the future of life on Earth at risk. He calls on world leaders to take urgent action to address the potential consequences of inaction.

The session concludes with a call for action. The delegates agree to work together to develop a plan to address the climate crisis and protect the planet. The emergency session is a historic event. It is the first time that the UN General Assembly has convened to address the status of Earth. The session is a clear sign that world leaders are recognizing the urgency of the climate crisis. In addition to resolving to clean up the Earth another secondary resolution is promoted and accepted. The UN General Assembly votes to address the possibility that their efforts will fail and that realistically they must plan an alternative. That alternative is establishing a colony on Mars just in case, so that the human species can continue. So this two prong approach shows that world leaders are willing to take action to protect the planet and that they recognize something must be done to ensure the existence of humankind. 


<b><center><font size="+1">UN sets guidelines on who gets chosen</font></center></b>
In the year 2035, the UN established guidelines for who could be chosen to inhabit Mars. There was much debate on this issue with many arguments and factions supporting different pieces of the arguments. 

If the reason to colonize Mars was to preserve the human species, then shouldn't the Mars colony consist of a representative sample of all those living on Earth. Using that argument, for every 100 humans sent to colonize Mars, 18 would be Indian, 17 Chinese, 4 U.S., 3 Indonesian, 2 Pakistani, 2 Brazilian, 2 Nigerian, 2 Bangladesh, 2 Russian, 1 Japanese and so on down the line.

<img src="Chapter01-b.gif" width="540" height="319" alt=""border="2">

The U.S. was the first to argue against this, citing that they funded over 20% of the UN and they were only being allocated 4% of the slots. Other smaller countries complained that they would have no representation at all and it was not fair to plan the extinction of their people just because it was a small amount. 

The United Nations has been tasked with establishing guidelines for who will be chosen to make this historic journey. The UN's guidelines are designed to ensure that the first humans to set foot on Mars are the best and brightest that humanity has to offer. They are also designed to ensure that the mission is as safe and successful as possible.

<b><font size="+1">The guidelines include the following criteria:</font></b>

The candidate must be in excellent physical and mental health.

The candidate must have a strong scientific background and be proficient in engineering and mathematics.

The candidate must be able to work well under pressure and be adaptable to new environments.

The candidate must be willing to make a long-term commitment to the mission.

The UN will also consider other factors, such as the candidate's age, gender, and cultural background. The goal is to create a diverse crew that represents the best of humanity. 

The selection process will be rigorous, but the rewards are great. The first humans to set foot on Mars will be remembered for generations to come. They will be the pioneers who blazed the trail for future generations of explorers.


<b><center><font size="+1">UN Selectors</font></center></b>
The UN has set up a group of individuals called Selectors.The UN Selectors were individuals actually tasked to take the UN Mars guidelines and put them into place. Selectors are recruiters of sorts who go through the UN criteria and match up applicants who want to go to Mars with the types of individuals needed by the UN as laid out in their guidelines. 

These are the professionals, doctors, lawyers, senior managers and tradesmen, carpenters, plumbers, electricians, solar specialists, wastewater managers etc. The volunteers and those recruited need to meet the UN standards besides their specialties.The Selectors were actually choosing the individuals who would make this historic journey. 

The Selectors task was to ensure that the first humans to set foot on Mars are the best and brightest that humanity has to offer. The Selectors would accomplish this by following the UN guidelines.

<b><center><font size="+1">Collectors</font></center></b>
<img src="Chapter01-c.gif" width="540" height="265" alt="" border="2">

Collectors work for Hy-Space. Collectors are individuals who actually collect people to go to the Moon and to serve the chosen ones on Mars. Some are recruited through advertisements for medical experiments or through religious cults. The religious cults convince people they are going to some mythical better place. The cult leaders are actually paid by Hy-Space for the recruits. These collected individuals typically have their brain harvested and are put in a rack in the Hy-Space brain warehouse on the Moon. Their brains are connected to exoskeletons that mostly work on Mars.

Many people are eager to leave Earth. They sign up with the Collectors without even thinking twice. They are so desperate for a better life that they are willing to believe anything. The Collectors take the people to the Moon, but it is not the paradise they promised. The Moon is barren and desolate. There is no vegetation, and the resources are scarce. The people who have been tricked are forced to live in harsh conditions.

They soon realize that they have been duped. They are trapped on the Moon, with no way to get back to Earth. They are forced to make a new life for themselves, in a place that is not what they expected.

The Collectors have tricked them, but they are not the only ones who are to blame. The people who were tricked were also willing to believe anything. They were so desperate for a better life that they were willing to overlook the obvious signs that something was wrong.

Marcus had a very specific reason for the collectors to recruit from religious cults. The religious recruits were his safety net. They had undying loyalty to "FOREVER." FOREVER was the supreme being in the soon to be developed neural network. It would eventually be called the ZON. Religious recruits would do anything without question to try to please FOREVER.

 No doubts, no hesitation, if FOREVER requested something then the religious recruits would sacrifice everything to provide it. For a religious recruit, nothing was more glorifying than being destroyed in the service of FOREVER. A religious recruit believed that being a martyr in the service of FOREVER would unite you with FOREVER for forever.

On May 5, 2015, NASA announced the "Journey to Mars Challenge." With that challenge NASA sought public input on establishing sustained human presence on the Red Planet. This challenge was released by NASA and I have taken this information from their announcements. NASA first started issuing Centennial Challenges in 2005 by offering incentive prizes to generate revolutionary solutions to problems. These Challenges included:

CO2 Conversion Challenge 

3D-Printed Habitat Challenge 

Vascular Tissue Challenge

Space Robotics Challenge


<b><center><font size="+1">Marcus Mephitis challenge </font></center></b>
Marcus wanted to produce his own challenges where the information belonged to him and his start up company MM LLC. MM LLC started out as a small aerospace subcontractor. In the beginning, Marcus just wanted to manufacture something, anything that would give him a government contract and connect his small company to the space exploration business. So the first thing he wanted to build was a Mars rover. He figured that the lunar rovers had made someone some money and now he put his thoughts to building a Mars rover. After doing research, Marcus found out that the first contract for a lunar rover was with Boeing. It was a cost plus incentive fee contract originally worth $19.6M and was supposed to be delivered by April 1971. With overruns it came in at around $38M. At least, that was what Google told him. 

So the same year NASA presents its challenges, Marcus presents his. Marcus' challenge was a competition to design and build a human-powered rover that can travel a half-mile obstacle course on Mars. The challenge is open to teams from all over the world, and it attracts over 100 teams from universities, high schools, and private companies. The teams spend months designing and building their rovers, and in 2016, they travel to the Mars Desert Research Station in Utah to compete in the challenge. The teams race their rovers through the obstacle course, which includes rocks, craters, and other challenges that simulate the terrain of Mars. Out of all of the entries, one entry is significantly better than the rest. Four aerospace engineers from Parks College of Engineering, Aviation and Technology won the challenge hands down. The significant thing about their entry was that it wasn't a rover at all. It was a manned drone. It didn't have to navigate, rocks, ditches or any of the other simulated Mars terrain. It simply flew over it all. Of course, Marcus being Marcus had no intention of awarding these engineering students the $50,000 that he had announced as the prize money. What he did do is convince all four of the students to come to work for him, which they did. He paid them the going rate for engineers at the time but also promised them that if their drone was a commercial success, they would all get to share in the IPO for the new company. 

Another part of their design was to use hydrogen as fuel. They figured that there was reported to be plenty of water embedded in the Mars crust. The water could be extracted and some used for future colonists and some of the water would be processed to produce through electrolysis hydrogen gas and oxygen gas. Oxygen would be used to create a liveable habitat and hydrogen would be used for fuel. The four engineers named their group for the challenge, the Hy-Drone Four. Not very imaginative but it worked for them. Four years later Marcus got enough backers to launch an Initial Public Offering (IPO) for Hy-Drone, an engineering company. Because Marcus really valued the original four engineers he kept his word and gave them their fair share of the IPO. The IPO was an unqualified success. Therefore, in 2020 four Parks College students became instant multimillionaires.

For Marcus, the Mars rover challenge was just the beginning. In the years since the challenge was launched, there has been a growing interest in Mars exploration. Hy-Drone and ultimately Hy-Space dominated the market for years to come for space travel, especially to Mars. 


<b><center><font size="+1">2023 From the narrator talking to Gene.

Gene brings up the idea of traveling through wormholes to reduce travel time to Mars</font></center></b>
<img src="Chapter01-e.gif" width="540" height="265" alt="" border="2">

One Tuesday back in May 2023, I was having a Fried Chicken dinner with my friends at the Grove. It was something I did fairly often back then. Besides being able to spend some time with my friends I had a chance to have some great conversations with other residents and guests. Plus the dinner only cost $10.95 at the time and included pie and ice cream if you requested it.

Gene L. Shoal, one of the residents, was sitting across from me at the dinner. In our conversation, he told me that he was an electrical engineer and worked for various companies in the area. We started talking about the space program and how our city played an integral part.

Getting somewhat off topic, like I often do, I started talking about the drone/helicopter that NASA was currently operating on Mars. Gene brought up the fact that it was very hard to control because of the time delay for instructions to travel from Earth to Mars. I asked what would happen if it gets blown off course and is headed for a rock outcropping. He told me if it needed an immediate course correction it would simply crash because the time delay wouldn't allow enough time for a timely correction.

I said there must be some theoretical way to decrease the time delay. Gene said he would think about it.

I saw Gene several weeks later, again on a Tuesday at the Grove. We had lasagna that day. Again it was delicious. I asked Gene if he thought of a solution to the time delay problem of sending instructions to Mars crafts. He said that he had just watched a Guardians of The Galaxy Movie and the solution was transmitting through wormholes in space. Since the instructions couldn't go faster than the speed of light the other variable to alter is the distance in space. If you could shorten the distance you shorten the time necessary for the instruction to reach Mars. If you shorten the distance significantly by using wormholes in space you can accomplish near real time interaction.

<b><center><font size="+1">Marcus leased Hawaiian island</font></center></b>
In 2030 Marcus Mephitis leased a portion of the Hawaiian island of Kahoolawe. Kahoolawe is only 44.6 square miles, has no fresh water and was used during World War 2 as a bombing range. It is surrounded by a lot of undetonated ordinance and is almost unapproachable by sea.

Marcus has worked with a few Native Hawaiian entities and is bankrolling its restoration. Specifically it is teaming with KIRC <a href="http://kahoolawe.hawaii.gov" target="_blank"><img src="Flag.Waving.gif" width="16" height="16" alt=""></a> (Kahoolawe Island Reserve Commission). In exchange for a twenty year lease on 100 acres, Marcus promised to work towards returning the island to its native state. This entailed reintroducing native plants, stopping erosion, reestablishing its water supply and creating ordnance free beaches and approach corridors. When the lease expires in 2050 he will turn it all over to KIRC.

Marcus used his 100 acres as a retreat and as a center for research and development. This particular R&D compound focused on robotics, exoskeletal enhancements for paraplegic and quadriplegic soldiers and brain interaction with those exoskeletons.

Marcus hired Dr. Sophia Dumas to lead his research team. Over the years Dr. Dumas had claimed a world wide reputation for being the leading authority for neural exoskeletal symbiosis (NES).

Cody Jacobs and Sophia Dumas were neighbors, they grew up together. They loved each other long before they ever fell in love with each other. They were typical mid-westerners growing up in a small town, St. Paul, Missouri. They lived in a subdivision on a cul-de-sac across from each other. The subdivision was very close to the Mississippi river. Adjacent to the flood plains actually. The only thing that saved their houses from being flooded each year was the new raised highway and levee called MO 79 expressway. Everyone still called it 79. Their town looked like it was going to be a boomtown for a while. St. Paul would double in size every couple of years. But because of economic downturns, overinflated land prices and growth of industrial farms, their subdivision pretty much became frozen in time and time simply passed it by. The town really shaped both of their lives. Cody loved the outdoors. He loved hunting and fishing. He had access to the many duck hunting lodges and clubs that were popular along the river. He also became an excellent hunter, mostly hunting white tail deer and migratory ducks. He also joined in with the neighbors to hunt the occasional bear or mountain lion that would wander through the lowlands. So it was a surprise to no one when Cody joined the army after high school graduation. As a member of the Armed Service he flourished. He especially distinguished himself during the war of 2044. He received two Purple Hearts, a Distinguished Service Cross and The Silver Star for combat in Norway. The only reason he didn't receive a medal for his service in Russia is because officially the U.S. never crossed over into Russia. He also served as an Army Ranger. 

Sophia took another route but she also left St. Paul upon graduating from high school. Her ticket out was via academics. She received a full ride to Stanford and never looked back nor did she ever come back to St. Paul. Sophia Dumas became a neural scientist specializing in connecting the human brain to exoskeletons. Achieved worldwide fame during the 2044 Drone Wars between NATO allies and Russia. She designed the first fully functional armored exoskeleton combat suit. Later she worked with the Wounded Warriors to give paralyzed soldiers their mobility back by connecting their brains to exoskeleton suits. Marcus Mephitis was successful in recruiting Sophia into his company. He very generously supported Dr. Dumas' work with the Wounded Warrior program. With Marcus' support, Dr. Dumas did accomplish remarkable things. Integrating prosthetics into exoskeletons and successfully attaching all to the brain, Dr. Dumas was able to literally give every wounded soldier their lives back. 

It was Marcus, however, who exploited Dr. Dumas' work and used the results to achieve great things on the Moon and Mars. Since Marcus never trusted the Chinese, he never bought into 100% AI controlled robots. He demanded that the control of all manufactured systems, whether it be drones, space ships or exoskeletons always without exception had some form of human control. There always had to be an identifiable brain either directly or indirectly controlling every object whether it be an exoskeleton, drone or space ship. When there was indirect control, there was always a short term protocol used to terminate the object. Depending on the object, one of three things must happen if indirect control happens. Primarily the object would cease functioning. This could happen in a variety of ways. It could blow up, stop in its tracks and shut down, return immediately to a predetermined rendezvous point or track and attack the source of the object that severed the connection. The last option was used very sparingly and only in specific situations because an object could suffer a severed connection due to friendly fire of some sort and the last thing you want in that situation are multiple objects tracking down and destroying the friendly fire source that severed the connection.


<b><font size="+1"><center>Marcus Mephitis gets remote diggers on Mars</center></font></b>
Marcus wanted to start excavation and construction on Mars as soon as possible to beat out all other possible competition. He figured the first thing he needed to do is to convince NASA to allow some of his equipment to be flown to Mars on a NASA spacecraft. He laid out his plan to his chief engineer. 
 
Marcus sat across from the chief construction engineer in a dimly lit office, the air thick with anticipation. They were about to embark on a daring mission to convince NASA to approve two remote-controlled trenchers as cargo on one of its unmanned flights to Mars.

"We need to be convincing," Marcus emphasized, his eyes gleaming with determination. "We have to make NASA believe that these trenchers are essential for a scientific experiment."

The engineer nodded eagerly. "I've prepared a detailed proposal outlining the scientific benefits of the trenchers. It's a foolproof plan."

Marcus leaned forward, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. "And if NASA asks about their true purpose?"

"We'll tell them the truth," the engineer replied, his face hardening with resolve. "We'll explain that these trenchers are vital for Hy-Space's construction operations on Mars. But we'll also emphasize the scientific benefits, just to cover our tracks."

Marcus nodded approvingly. "Excellent. We can't afford any slip-ups. This is our chance to get these trenchers onto Mars without raising any red flags."

The engineer spread out a map of the Martian terrain on the table. "Once the trenchers are on Mars, we can use them to excavate sites for our construction projects. They'll be invaluable for building our new Martian outposts."

Marcus' eyes lit up with excitement. "Imagine the possibilities! With these trenchers, we can accelerate our construction efforts exponentially. We'll be years ahead of the competition."

The engineer smiled confidently. "Indeed. And with NASA's approval, we can avoid any legal repercussions. It's a brilliant plan, Marcus."

Marcus leaned back in his chair, a sense of satisfaction washing over him. He had always been a man of vision, a master strategist with a knack for turning audacious plans into reality. And this time, he was confident that he would succeed once again.

"Let's get to work," he declared, his voice filled with determination. "We have a lot to do before NASA's next unmanned mission to Mars."

With renewed vigor, Marcus and the engineer delved into their preparations, meticulously crafting their proposal and refining their strategy. They were determined to convince NASA of the trenchers' scientific importance, all while concealing their true purpose: to revolutionize Hy-Space's construction operations on Mars.

Marcus and his chief engineer sat across from a panel of NASA executives, their hearts pounding in their chests. This was it, the culmination of months of planning and preparation. Their mission: to convince NASA to approve two remote-controlled trenchers as cargo on one of its unmanned flights to Mars.

Marcus took a deep breath and began his presentation, his voice steady and confident. He outlined the scientific benefits of the trenchers, emphasizing their ability to collect valuable geological data and aid in the search for extraterrestrial life. The NASA executives listened attentively, their faces unreadable.

The engineer followed Marcus, providing detailed technical specifications and highlighting the trenchers' potential for future scientific missions. He spoke with passion and expertise, his words painting a vivid picture of the trenchers at work on the Martian landscape.

The NASA executives remained silent, their expressions enigmatic. Marcus and his engineer exchanged glances, their nerves on edge. Had they done enough? Had they convinced NASA of the trenchers' importance?

After what seemed like an eternity, one of the NASA executives spoke up. "Your proposal is very persuasive," he said, his voice tinged with skepticism. "But we're still not entirely convinced."

Marcus' heart sank. He had sensed this coming, but he wasn't ready to give up yet. "I understand your concerns," he replied, his voice unwavering. "But I assure you, these trenchers are not only scientifically valuable but also essential for our construction operations on Mars."

Marcus then proceeded to explain how the trenchers would revolutionize Hy-Space's construction efforts, enabling them to excavate sites and build outposts with unprecedented efficiency. He painted a picture of a thriving Martian colony, powered by Hy-Space's innovative technology.

The NASA executives listened intently, their expressions softening. Marcus could see the wheels turning in their minds, the realization that these trenchers were not just scientific tools but also instruments of progress.

Finally, the same NASA executive spoke again. "We've decided to approve your proposal," he announced, a hint of satisfaction in his voice. "We believe that these trenchers have the potential to make a significant contribution to our understanding of Mars."

Marcus and his engineer erupted in silent jubilation. They had done it! They had convinced NASA to approve their groundbreaking technology, paving the way for Hy-Space's dominance in the Martian construction industry.

As the meeting concluded, Marcus shook hands with the NASA executives, a sense of triumph coursing through his veins. He had once again proven his ability to turn dreams into reality, and he knew that this was just the beginning of Hy-Space's extraordinary journey to Mars.

In early 2040, Marcus was able to convince NASA to include two remote controlled trenchers on one of its unmanned flights to Mars. He convinced them it was for a scientific study and promised to share the results of his experiments. So by fall of 2040, Hy-Space industries was conducting tests on Mars with their remote controlled trenchers. The communications were slow at the time, but with patience they were able to get some pretty impressive results.

"The Nazca Lines are a group of geoglyphs made in the soil of the Nazca Desert in southern Peru. They were created between <font color=#ffffff>500 BCE</font> and <font color=#ffffff>500 CE</font> by people making depressions or shallow incisions in the desert floor, removing pebbles and leaving differently colored dirt exposed."

<img src="Chapter01-h.gif" width="540" height="213" alt="">


Much has been written and reported concerning the Nazca Lines. Could they have really been made with primitive tools or were they made by aliens from some sort of spacecraft? Those questions are still being debated. What isn't being debated is the fact that they started showing up again. Not on Earth but on Mars. 

<img src="Chapter01-i.gif" width="540" height="293" alt="">


<b><center><font size="+1">The Nazca Lines first showed up on Mars
June 1, 2040</font></center></b>
They were spotted by employees in the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) who were tasked to map parts of Mars. Instead of being ancient drawings they were being carved into the planet with remote controlled earth movers. At first it was thought to be a joke or prank. The common thought in academia was that graduate students from MIT, Stanford or U of C, Berkeley, had hacked excess equipment on Mars and programmed them to carve the drawings. Then it continued, month after month for a couple of years. It got more attention but still the consensus was that new students were taking on the project as they were tutored by outgoing graduates. The Nazca Lines on Mars caught the attention of a senior producer of Global News Network (GNN). He tagged Betty to do a human interest story about the Martian Nazca Lines and try to find out who was behind creating them, why they were creating them and why in that particular location. 

Betty quickly found out the following. The lines were being created not by some graduate students, but rather at the direction of Marcus Mephitis by his company Hy-Space. The lines were being drawn in the Schiaparelli Crater. It was an odd place to do work because by most common reports, NASA had never developed any method of retrieving water, in that area and after the Russian invasion of Norway and the resulting war, NASA completely abandoned the Schiaparelli Crater project.The Schiaparelli Crater was located near the Martian equator. It is about 460 km in diameter and about 2 feet deep and since it is an impact crater it has a small rim around its diameter. It was explored by NASA in the mid to late 2030s and NASA determined that there was a significant deposit of water trapped in the sentiment below the surface. This is consistent with theories that a significant amount of Mars water did not evaporate into space but rather retreated into Mars crust. This process is called by some scientists, crustal hydration. 

Apparently the common wisdom on that subject was completely wrong. Marcus found out that NASA had dug some experimental wells in the 2030s and actually did find water in the Schiaparelli Crater. They capped the wells and did abandon the project. Now with newer technology and a better understanding of the problems that NASA faced in actually retrieving the water, Marcus was sure that he could not only harvest water from this area but he could do it rather cheaply while making exorbitant amounts of money selling the water to the United Nations planned colony on Mars. 

Never one to sit on or not to exploit every opportunity that came his way, Marcus had his minions successfully lobby and draw up a contract with the UN to buy back all the water that he could produce on Mars. 

With this simple contract, Marcus, through his company Hy-Space Engineering, secured an open-ended contract to provide all the water he could to the UN's Martian colony. The agreed upon price was based on the cost of water if it would be transported via space tanker from Earth to Mars. Marcus' company was able to extract water from Mars and deliver it at a fraction of that cost. 

With his cash cow of a contract in place, everything changed. It wasn't drawings any longer, it looked like foundations were being poured. The prank turned into an expensive construction project. By July 2045, there was a full blown multibillion dollar construction site on Mars.


<b><center><font size="+1">Betty Ballena of GNN starts investigating MM LLC. </font></center></b>
It was a cold and rainy night in the city. Betty, a young reporter for the local newspaper, was sitting in her car, parked outside the headquarters of MM LLC. She had been staking out the building for hours, hoping to catch Marcus Mephitis in the act of doing something illegal.

So far, she had come up empty-handed. But she wasn't giving up. She knew that Marcus was a corrupt industrialist who was cheating the government on multiple contracts. She was determined to expose him.

Suddenly, she saw a light go on in one of the offices. She got out of her car and crept up to the building. She peered through the window and saw Marcus sitting at his desk, talking on the phone.

Betty couldn't hear what he was saying, but she could tell that he was nervous. He kept glancing around the room, as if he was worried that someone was watching him.

Betty took out her phone and started recording. She wanted to get everything Marcus Mephitis said on tape.

After a few minutes, Marcus hung up the phone. He got up from his desk and walked over to the window. Betty ducked down, so he wouldn't see her. Marcus stood at the window for a few minutes, looking out at the city. Then he turned and walked back to his desk. He sat down and started typing on his computer.

Betty watched him for a few more minutes, but she didn't see anything else incriminating. She decided to go back to her car and wait for him to leave. She waited for hours, but Marcus didn't come out of the building. Finally, she gave up and went home. But she wasn't discouraged. She knew that she had come close to catching Marcus in the act. She would be back tomorrow, and she would be even more determined to get the evidence she needed.

The next day, Betty went back to MM LLC. She staked out the building again, and this time she was rewarded for her patience. She saw Marcus come out of the building and get into his car. She followed him to his office, and she watched him go inside.

Betty waited a few minutes, and then she went into the office. She found Marcus' computer and started looking through his files. She found a file labeled "Government Contracts." She opened the file and started reading.

She saw that Marcus had been awarded a number of government contracts, but he had not fulfilled his obligations under the contracts. He had also overcharged the government for his services. Betty had the evidence she needed. She had proof that Marcus was a corrupt industrialist who was cheating the government.

She wrote a report about her findings and submitted it to her editor. The editor was impressed with her work. The editor wanted additional corroberation for her story. She tried for months but she never found anyone who was willing to either officially go on the record, much less testify in court. She knew that Marcus Mephitis and Hy-Space were involved in illegal practices and she vowed that one day she would be able to expose them. But it would not be this day with this story. So she held the story for another time and more evidence.
