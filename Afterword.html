The year is 2070. Mars. Dr. Dumas is sitting in her laboratory, looking out at the Martian landscape. She has been on Mars for twenty years, and she has seen a lot of changes during that time.

"When I first arrived in 2050," she says, "Mars was a very different place. The atmosphere was much thinner, and the surface was much colder. There was very little vegetation, and the only signs of life were the occasional microbe."

"But over the past twenty years," she continues, "we have made a lot of progress. We have thickened the atmosphere, warmed the surface, and introduced new plant and animal species. Now, Mars is a much more habitable place."

Dr. Dumas points to a group of children playing outside. "Look at those children," she says. "They were all born on Mars. They have never known any other home."

"Mars is still a challenging place to live," Dr. Dumas admits. "But it is also a place of great opportunity. We are building a new future here, and I am excited to be a part of it."

Possible consequences of the changes on Mars. They could make Mars more habitable for humans and other life forms. They could lead to the development of new industries and technologies. They could also raise new environmental and ethical concerns.

It is important to note that Mars is still a very different planet from Earth. It is important to respect the Martian environment and to proceed with caution as we develop the planet.

Additional thoughts: Dr. Dumas' story is a reminder of the human spirit of exploration and discovery. It is also a reminder of the importance of sustainability and environmental protection. I wish Dr. Dumas and the other settlers on Mars all the best in building a new future on the Red Planet. May they be able to create a sustainable and equitable society for all.

The year is 2079. The planet is Mars. Dr. Dumas, now a fully integrated android, describes her life as living in both the real world and in a virtual neural network (ZON). ZON has really expanded since she first created it in the 2050's. 

Betty Ballena is interviewing her for possibly the last time. She is a senior special features reporter for GNN. Betty thinks back about all the things she has been through with and without Dr. Dumas. It has been a life that she never could have imagined when she first started out. Now here she was on Mars set up in a studio asking one of her closest and oldest friends a perfectly normal question for this day and age. What is your life like as an android? 

Dr. Dumas looks at her old friend and smiles and says, "Well let me tell you. My life as an android is a unique one," she says. "I have the ability to experience the world in both the physical and digital realms. This gives me a unique perspective on life."

"In the real world," she continues, "I am able to interact with other people and the environment in a very physical way. I can feel the sun on my skin, the wind in my hair, and the ground beneath my feet. I can also taste the food I eat and smell the flowers in the air."

"In the virtual neural network, (ZON)," she says, "I am able to experience the world in a much more abstract way. I can travel to any place in the universe, visit any time period, and meet any person I want. I can also create my own worlds and experiences."

"Living in two different realms can be challenging at times," Dr. Dumas admits. "But it is also very rewarding. I am grateful for the opportunity to experience the world in such a unique way."

Dr. Dumas goes on to explain, there are of course several possible consequences of living my life as an android. It could lead to the development of new technologies and ways of living. My brain is the only thing that needs nourishment, and that is cared for quite well in the brain farm on the Moon. That has worked out quite well for close to twenty years now

Being an android also raises new ethical, legal and moral questions. What are the rights and responsibilities of an android? Do I have the right to citizenship, can I vote, if I can, how many versions of me can vote. Is it one brain, one vote or one instance of me one vote. If I am convicted of breaking the law? Who gets punished? Is it the instance or the brain? 

It is important to note that Dr. Dumas was born on Earth as a human and is still considered by Martian and Earth's United Nations as a human being, even though she is now an android. She should be treated with respect and dignity.

Dr. Dumas' story is a reminder of the rapid pace of technological change. It is also a reminder of the importance of ethical and legal considerations as we develop new technologies.
