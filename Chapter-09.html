<center><font size="+2">UN appoints Grace Roseberg
Chief Environmentalist on Mars</font></center>
Grace Roseberg, a thirty year old environmental activist, and the previous governor of Mars, is chosen by the UN to manage the carbon footprint and environmental health on Mars. One of her responsibilities, amongst a host of others, is to follow up on complaints.  Grace Roseberg is on Mars inspecting a Hy-Space mine. She is following up on complaints that the mine is not safe and does not follow established mining safety rules. It has been rumored that some miners have lost ther lives in these mines due to cave ins, but those were just rumors, or are they just rumors? Upon entering the mine, this is what she finds.

As Grace Roseberg stepped into the dimly lit confines of the Hy-Space mine on Mars, a sense of foreboding washed over her. The complaints she had received about safety violations had painted a grim picture, but nothing could have prepared her for the scene that unfolded before her. The mine, a labyrinth of shafts and tunnels carved into the Martian bedrock, was a far cry from the well-ordered, safety-conscious operations she was accustomed to. The air was thick with dust and the gauges that she carried showed that the tunnels were filled with exhaust fumes. The ground was littered with debris and discarded equipment. 

Grace's heart pounded as she ventured deeper into the mine, her eyes scanning for the numerous hazards that lay hidden in the shadows. Exposed electrical wires snaked along the walls, posing a constant threat of electrocution. Precarious supports groaned under the weight of the unstable rock formations above, threatening to collapse at any moment. Grace's anger flared as she witnessed the miners' plight. Although the mine was mostly automated and most of the work was conducted by brain controlled exoskeletons, some humans did have to actually do work in the mine. Hy-Space, a corporation known for its ruthless pursuit of profit, had placed its insatiable greed above the well-being of its workers. The mine was a ticking time bomb, a testament to the company's callous disregard for human life.

With a surge of determination, Grace resolved to bring these safety violations to light. She meticulously documented her observations, gathering evidence of the company's negligence. She would not rest until Hy-Space was held accountable for its actions, until the miners were granted the safe and secure working environment they deserved.

While Grace is walking back towards the mine's entrance the ceiling at the entrance collapses and blocks the entrance. She must now find another way out. Grace's heart pounded in her chest as she heard the ominous rumble echoing through the mine. She was trapped, alone in the depths of the dangerous mine.

Panic threatened to consume her, but Grace forced herself to take a deep breath and assess the situation. She was a seasoned mining inspector, trained to handle emergencies. She would find a way out. Grace quickly turned and began exploring other tunnels, her flashlight cutting through the darkness. She remembered a map she had seen earlier, indicating an alternate route that led to an abandoned ventilation shaft. It was a long shot, but it was her only hope.

As she navigated the labyrinthine tunnels, Grace's mind raced with calculations. She had to conserve her oxygen, which was slowly depleting, in the confined space. She also had to avoid any further cave-ins, as the mine was now structurally unstable.

After what seemed like an eternity, Grace stumbled upon the ventilation shaft. It was a narrow opening, barely large enough for her to squeeze through. But it was her only chance of escape.

With a deep breath, Grace squeezed into the shaft, her body scraping against the rough metal walls. She crawled forward, her heart pounding in her chest, until she heard and felt another great rumbling. Dirt started falling on her head. As quickly as possible she backed out of the ventilation shaft. She scrambled out of the ventilation shaft just as dust, rock and dirt replaced what was once her only possible escape. She still had oxygen left and it wasn't in her DNA to give up, so she kept searching for another passage. 

She crawled through a small tunnel into a larger chamber. Grace's eyes widened as she emerged from the narrow tunnel into a spacious chamber, its walls adorned with intricate carvings and symbols that seemed to glow with an ethereal light. At the center of the room stood an imposing cylindrical object, its metallic surface gleaming under the soft illumination. The tube-like structure had blinking lights. 

Intrigued by the enigmatic device, Grace cautiously approached, her footsteps echoing in the vast emptiness of the chamber. The cylindrical object emitted a low hum, its surface pulsating with a soft, rhythmic glow. As Grace neared, she could sense a faint energy emanating from it, a tingling sensation that coursed through her fingertips. She inspected it and determined it might be some form of a transporter. She studied it, but doesn't really want to get inside because she doesn't really know what it is, or where it will take her. 

About a hundred feet from her, another large mass of ceiling collapses. Air is running out and so is her time. Grace is feeling desperate, she jumps into the teleport and hits the big green button. At the same time a crack starts widening on the tunnel floor. The machine rocks and dumps her out onto the mine floor. The teleport machine is starting to make a high pitch whine and starts vibrating. Grace reaches for a strap to pull herself back in. Two seconds later everything goes black. The last thing Grace sees are her two feet and a hand, bleeding on the floor of the tunnel.

Grace originally thought that she had died. When she saw her limbs on the tunnel floor, she thought the teleporter had malfunctioned and ripped her apart. She opened her eyes, or at least she felt like she was opening her eyes, but at this point she didn't know for sure what was happening. All she saw was a bright white light. So this is death she thought. She had moved on to her next phase and it was bright, but besides that, it felt very mellow and very relaxed. 

The next thing she heard was a pleasant voice all dressed in white saying, "Continue to look into the light please." Grace thought, "Ok, I was doing it wrong, I need to look directly into the light in order to pass over into the great beyond. I can do that." Then the light was pulled away and she saw Dr. Dumas. Or at least a perfect version of Dr. Dumas. Her skin was flawless and she looked a few years younger than she looked on TV. Grace is still shaken from her ordeal, but she is relieved to see her friend.

"Sophia," she says. "I'm so glad to see you." "I'm glad to see you too, Grace," Sophia says. "I was so worried about you." "I thought I was going to die," Grace says. "I saw my own limbs on the floor of the tunnel. I thought the teleporter had malfunctioned and ripped me apart." "It's okay, Grace," Sophia says. "You're safe now."

"But how?" Grace asks, "How did I get here?"

Sophia tells her to just listen to what she is going to say. It won't make much sense the first few times that she hears it, but eventually she will be able to understand what is going on. 

Grace's first questions were, "How am I here and how are you here? Are we both dead?" 

Dr. Dumas explained that they were both very much alive, but in different ways. Grace was alive in the traditional way but what Grace was looking at was an android version of Dr. Dumas connected to her very real and very alive brain. Dr. Dumas went on to explain that she was here because Dr. Dumas had rescued her through teleportation. Sophia explained that the teleporter only moved objects inside the machine. When she was knocked out, she didn't get fully in before the teleportation began. That's why part of her legs and left hand were on the tunnel floor. Sophia assured her she could be good as new in no time.

Dr. Dumas, a renowned neurosurgeon, is able to produce near-human-like prosthetics. She gives Grace Roseberg new legs and a new left hand, making her partially bionic.

Grace is initially hesitant to accept the prosthetics, but she eventually agrees. She is desperate to regain her mobility and independence.

Dr. Dumas performs the surgery flawlessly. Grace's new prosthetics are a marvel of modern medicine. They are both functional and aesthetically pleasing.

After a few weeks of physical therapy, Grace is able to walk and use her new hand with ease. She is thrilled to be able to move freely again.

Grace's new prosthetics also have some unexpected benefits. She is now able to run faster and lift heavier objects than she ever could before. She is also able to sense her environment in new and exciting ways.

Grace is grateful to Dr. Dumas for giving her a new life. She is now a stronger and more capable person than she ever was before. Dr. Dumas told Grace that they were collecting evidence against Marcus Mephitis and Hy-Space. She asked her to pass on her report about the Hy-Space mines to Alexandra Cafard. Ms. Cafard is the UN appointed prosecutor on Mars.
