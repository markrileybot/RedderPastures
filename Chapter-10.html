<center><font size="+2">United Nations International Court of Justice</font></center>
<center><font size="+2">Marcus is charged
and a warrant is put out for his arrest</font></center>
The UN, through the International Court of Justice (ICJ), puts a warrant out for Marcus' arrest for crimes against humanity. Marcus gets tipped off that they plan to arrest him at his New York office. Knowing that, he hops on his private jet at Teterboro Airport and flies to New Zealand to hide out in his bunker. UN authorities receive an anonymous tip from someone with a code name of Pandora, that Marcus has fled to New Zealand. Pandora also provides the coordinates of his bunker. The UN works with Interpol and local New Zealand authorities and plan to arrest Marcus and bring him to trial.

<center><font size="+2">Marcus is located in New Zealand and chased</font></center>
Authorities think they have him trapped at his compound in NZ. He is completely surrounded by 4x4 pickup trucks with helicopters overhead. The roads leading away from the compound all have road blocks with tire spikes laid across all lanes. 

Marcus again is tipped off that the authorities are coming for him in New Zealand. He is convinced that someone in the company is tipping off the authorities concerning his whereabouts. So he makes the decision to flee to Mars. Once he has made this decision he has a certain calmness about him. As a matter of fact he makes a few phone calls from which he gets assurances that plans are in place. Then he goes back and finishes his meal even while he can hear sirens and see lights approaching his bunker. 

While he is eating, a rocket takes off from his compound barely missing the helicopters circling overhead. As he looks out the window and watches it soar into space, he announces that he is ready for dessert. He orders fresh apple pie a la mode with vanilla ice cream and caramel syrup on top. He knows that he will not be able to eat like this for quite some time. 

Next, with radios blaring, four Jeeps come roaring out of a garage nearby and take off in four different directions all headed for a main road and the awaiting authorities. This is his que to leave the compound. Marcus goes to a nearby hangar on the compound and exits it in one of his stealth drones. He silently heads toward the Kawarau Gorge and drops down to closely follow the Kawarau River. He is alerted that one of the helicopters is following him. It was apparently holding back from the rest of the activity just to see if there was another escape route that they hadn't thought about. The helicopter, for all practical purposes, is chasing a shadow. Using night vision Marcus' pilot K.J. Harriss is able to stay just inches above the river. His drone is completely dark on the outside with no running lights whatsoever. The helicopter pilot loses sight of the drone from time to time as the drone dips in and out of shadows and winds its way through the Gorge, hugging its East side. 

In no time Marcus' drone is at the Kawarau Gorge Suspension Bridge. Bungee jumpers are still actively jumping off the bridge. Staying low and hugging the East side, Marcus' pilot easily and swiftly navigates under the bridge, avoiding the jumpers and swinging around the bend. The helicopter pulls up to stay away from the jumpers, goes over the bridge and loses Marcus' drone. Marcus knows it is only a couple of minutes down to the Queenstown Airport. The authorities will be on the alert, but with all of the airport congestion he is relatively sure that he will be able to slip by and get to Lake Wakatiou. 

By staying in the Gorge and close to the river, Marcus is able to easily follow the Kawarau River down to Queenstown. Once safely past the Queenstown Airport, he hugs the South shore of Lake Wakatiou all the way to Greenstone. From there he exits the lake and flies through the valleys to Big Bay, where he has a small submarine waiting for him. 

The drone is scuttled in the ocean at Big Bay. Somewhat safe in his small sub, he makes his way to Ahuriri Point at the southern tip of Mahia Peninsula, on the east coast of New Zealand's North Island. This is Marcus' territory, home of Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 or Spaceport. Marcus owns Spaceport and he knows that tomorrow there is a scheduled orbital weather satellite launch. The craft that takes off the next day will have the same signature and clearance of the weather satellite, the big difference being that it will contain Marcus.

The "weather satellite" takes off as scheduled. Ten hours later it rendezvous with the cargo ship that launched from Marcus compound a day earlier. The cargo ship heads for the Moon where Marcus makes plans for his trip to Mars. Back on Earth, Hy-Space holds a press conference where it declares that Marcus has been in a drone accident somewhere over Big Bay NZ and is currently missing. 

Marcus in disguise boards a routine tanker ship and starts his journey to Mars. On day two of the journey, the captain of the tanker ship, Captain Russell meets his few passengers for dinner. While he is having dinner with his passengers he sends Norman on a mission. Norman makes his way to Marcus' bunk and collects some hair off his comb which is in a locker by his bunk. Norman takes the hair and places it in a fluorescent orange cylinder about the size of a tennis ball can. With the next day's waste dump, Norman flushes the cylinder out into space. Shortly thereafter Scotty Armstrong comes along in his smallest and fastest ship, collects the orange cylinder and brings it back to the Moon. On the Moon he meets with an exoskeleton controlled by Dr. Dumas' brain who tests the hair sample and confirms it is the DNA of Marcus Mephitis. 

As Pandora, Dr. Dumas contacts Mars Space Force Control and alerts them that Marcus Mephitis is on the tanker ship captained by Russell and will be arriving at Mars in approximately five months.

<center><font size="+2">The Trial</font></center>
<img src="Chapter10-b.gif" width="530" height="265" alt="" border="2">

Alexandra Cafard was a lawyer and the UN prosecutor on Mars. Her responsibility was to bring Marcus Mephitis to trial for his crimes against the human species. She was fully aware that Marcus, while in prison, was living in a resort. She knew that the "guards" were really there not to keep Marcus in, but instead to keep Marcus safe and to help him plan his escape. Alexandra, however, had a very long talk with her daughter Betty, and Betty assured her that plans were in place to make sure Marcus received justice. Although Betty couldn't tell Alexandra any specifics about what Betty and Dr. Dumas were planning, Alexandra had complete faith in them. So she spent her days preparing the prosecution, knowing full well that things would probably not go as planned.

Marcus has been apprehended on Mars and charged with multiple crimes. He pleads nolo contendere. He did this for two reasons. First, he is absolutely confident that he will be able to escape from whatever form of restraint that he will be put in on Mars. Secondly by offering a plea of nolo contendere he will avoid having a guilty plea used against him in another case should he be charged on Earth in a civil or criminal suit. 

Alexandra Cafard has already received some very damning evidence. A couple of weeks prior, a group of environmental volunteers were cleaning up an old waste dump. They were not prepared for what they found. It was hundreds of skeletons dumped in an out of the way gully. Forensics showed that they were human and the remains' DNA was traced back to some of the subjects that Hy-Space had recruited for experiments on the Moon. When Hy-Space officials were presented with this evidence, two of them turned state's evidence and implicated Marcus and explained his scheme. Alexandra presented this and other information at the trial. 

Alexandra Cafard is a UN Prosecutor tasked with prosecuting Marcus Mephitis, the CEO of Hy-Space, with crimes against humanity. Marcus is accused of a wide range of crimes, including genocide, enslavement, and torture.

Cafard is a brilliant and determined prosecutor. She has spent her entire career fighting for justice for victims of human rights abuses. She is determined to bring Marcus to justice and to hold him accountable for his crimes.

Marcus is a powerful and ruthless businessman. He has used his wealth and influence to avoid prosecution for his crimes. He is confident that he will be acquitted of all charges.

The trial is a major event on Mars. It is the first time that a CEO of a major corporation has been tried for crimes against humanity. The trial is also a test of the Martian legal system.

<center><font size="+2">Opening remarks in the Marcus Mephitis trial
by UN prosecutor Cafard:</font></center>
Cafard: Your Honor, members of the jury, we are gathered here today to try Marcus Mephitis, the CEO of Hy-Space, for crimes against humanity. Marcus is accused of a wide range of crimes, including genocide, enslavement, and torture.

Marcus is a ruthless businessman who has used his wealth and power to exploit and abuse others. He has created a system of modern-day slavery on Mars, and he has shown no regard for human life.

The evidence against Marcus is overwhelming. We will present testimony from witnesses who have seen firsthand the atrocities that Marcus has committed. We will also present evidence that shows that Marcus ordered and condoned these atrocities.

Marcus' crimes are not only heinous, they are also a threat to the future of Mars. Marcus' vision for Mars is a world where the powerful exploit the weak and where there is no justice for the victims of crime.

We cannot allow Marcus to succeed. We must convict him of all charges and send a message to the world that we will not tolerate crimes against humanity.

In this trial, we will show that Marcus is not a businessman, but a criminal. We will show that he is not a visionary, but a tyrant. And we will show that he must be held accountable for his crimes.

<center><font size="+2">Opening remarks in the Marcus Mephitis trial
by the defense attorney:</font></center>
Your Honor, members of the jury, my client, Marcus Mephitis, is innocent of the charges against him. He is a successful businessman who has created jobs and prosperity for Mars. He is also a philanthropist who has donated millions of Hydros to Martian charities.

The prosecution has not presented any credible evidence to support its claims. The witnesses they have called are unreliable and their testimony is full of holes.

The prosecution is trying to paint my client as a monster, but he is not. He is a man who is passionate about Mars and its people. He wants to build a better future for all Martians.

The prosecution has also tried to make this case about race and class. They have tried to pit the poor against the rich, and the workers against the owners of capital. But this case is not about race or class. It is about justice.

My client is entitled to a fair trial, and he is confident that the jury will find him innocent.

Thank you.

The defense attorney's opening remarks are designed to downplay the evidence against Marcus and to discredit the prosecution's witnesses. The defense attorney also tries to portray Marcus as a victim of a politically motivated prosecution.

<center><font size="+2">Closing remarks in the Marcus Mephitis trial
by UN prosecutor Alexandra Cafard:</font></center>
Your Honor, members of the jury, we have come to the end of this trial. Over the past few weeks, you have heard testimony from witnesses who have seen firsthand the atrocities that Marcus Mephitis has committed. You have also heard evidence that shows that Marcus ordered and condoned these atrocities.

The evidence against Marcus is overwhelming. He is guilty of genocide, enslavement, and torture. He is a criminal and a tyrant. We have presented you with clear and irrefutable evidence. Besides eyewitness testimony, we have presented physical proof and a clear timeline of events. 

Marcus' defense attorneys have tried to downplay the evidence and to discredit the witnesses. But they have failed. The evidence is clear and convincing, Marcus is guilty.

The burden of proof lies with us the prosecutors. You have seen evidence. You have heard the truth. This case is about justice. Find the defendant guilty as charged. Thank you.

<center><font size="+2">Closing remarks in the Marcus Mephitis trial
by the defense attorney:</font></center>
Your Honor, members of the jury, we have come to the end of this trial. Over the past few weeks, you have heard testimony from witnesses who have claimed to have seen firsthand the atrocities that Marcus Mephitis has committed. You have also heard evidence that purportedly shows that Marcus ordered and condoned these atrocities.

But the evidence against Marcus is far from overwhelming. It is circumstantial and it is based on the testimony of unreliable witnesses.

The prosecution has tried to paint my client as a monster, but he is not. He is a successful businessman who has created jobs and prosperity for Mars. He is also a philanthropist who has donated millions of Hydros to Martian charities.

Thank you.

Cafard presents a compelling case against Marcus. She calls witnesses who testify to the atrocities that Marcus has committed. She also presents evidence that shows that Marcus ordered and condoned these atrocities.

Marcus' lawyers try to discredit the witnesses and to downplay the evidence. However, Cafard is able to rebut their arguments.

<center><font size="+2">Marcus is found guilty</font></center>
The trial lasts for several months. In the end, the jury finds Marcus guilty of all charges. 

The judge's voice echoed through the silent courtroom: "Marcus Mephitis, you have been found guilty on all counts of crimes against humanity. I hereby sentence you to life in prison without the possibility of parole."

As soon as the judge finished speaking, the lights in the courtroom went out. The room was plunged into darkness, and the only sound was the muffled gasps of the audience. 

<center><font size="+2">Disappears at sentencing</font></center>
In the darkness, there was a stir in the defendant's cage. Marcus stood up, his face illuminated by the faint glow of the emergency lights. He smiled cruelly.

"This is not over," he said. "You will all pay for this."

The lights came back on, and Marcus was gone. The courtroom erupted in chaos as people tried to figure out what had happened.

The guards searched the courtroom and the surrounding area, but they couldn't find Marcus anywhere. It was as if he had vanished into thin air.

The escape of Marcus Mephitis was a major setback for the Martian government. It showed that even the most powerful criminals could escape justice. It also raised concerns about the security of the Martian prison system.

The government launched a massive manhunt for Marcus, but he was never found. He disappeared without a trace, and his fate remains unknown to this day.

Some believe that Marcus is still out there, planning his revenge. Others believe that he is dead. But one thing is for sure: the world is a safer place without Marcus Mephitis in it.

Some have speculated that Marcus had used his vast resources to develop a technology that allowed him to teleport. Others have suggested that he was aided by a group of loyal followers. But whatever the truth may be, the escape of Marcus Mephitis remains one of the most puzzling and disturbing events in Martian history.

<center><font size="+2">Zombies are forced back onto CS-313</font></center>
Betty has been rescued, Cody's head is going to the Moon and zombies are loose on Mars. Captain Russel and Dr. Dumas develop a plan to get the zombies onto CS-313 and launch them back into space. Using sonic blasters and pinging the queen bee they are able to get the zombies back on CS-313. This is how they do it.

<center><font size="+2">Operation Space Sweep:
Eliminating the Martian Zombie Threat</font></center>
With Betty safe and Cody's head secured for its lunar journey, Captain Russell and Dr. Dumas faced the stark reality of a zombie infestation on Mars. They needed a solution, and they needed it fast.

Their plan was audacious: lure the zombies back onto the abandoned research vessel CS-313 and launch it back into space. The success of the mission hinged on two key elements: sonic blasters and the queen bee.

The Sonic Blasters: Dr. Dumas, utilizing her expertise in bio-acoustics, had further optimized the sonic blasters. These weapons emitted high-pitched frequencies that were specifically designed to disorient and incapacitate the zombies. The idea was to drive the horde towards the CS-313, using the sonic blasts to guide their movement.

Pinging the queen bee: Captain Russell, drawing upon his years of military experience, recognized the importance of targeting the queen bee. It was the central controller of the hive mind, directing the movements and actions of the zombie horde. By tracking and emitting specific sonic frequencies, they could manipulate the queen bee's movements, effectively leading the entire horde towards their desired destination.

The Execution: The operation commenced with strategic positioning of the sonic blasters around the perimeter of the CS-313. Captain Russell and his team, armed with their modified blasters, took up defensive positions. Then, Dr. Dumas activated the queen bee tracker, emitting a series of precise sonic pulses.

As predicted, the queen bee responded to the signal, altering the direction of the horde. The zombies, drawn by the queen's commands and disoriented by the sonic blasts, began their slow but relentless march towards the research vessel.

Captain Russell and his team carefully monitored the movement of the horde, adjusting the frequency and intensity of the sonic blasts to guide them towards the open hatch of the CS-313. The tension was palpable as the zombies shambled closer, their guttural moans and rasping breaths filling the air.

Finally, the last zombie stumbled aboard the research vessel. With a swift motion, Captain Russell activated the launch sequence. The engines roared to life, the ground trembling as the CS-313 detached from its moorings and began its ascent into the Martian sky.

Mission Accomplished: As the CS-313 disappeared into the vastness of space, carrying the zombie threat along with it, a wave of relief washed over Captain Russell and his team. They had successfully averted a potentially catastrophic disaster, saving countless lives and ensuring the safety of humanity's first Martian colony.

Their innovative plan, combining sonic technology and strategic manipulation of the queen bee, had proven to be a resounding success. It was a testament to their courage, ingenuity, and unwavering determination in the face of a terrifying and seemingly insurmountable threat.

However, Captain Russell knew their work was not over. The threat of the zombies might be gone for now, but the lessons learned from this ordeal would forever be etched in their memories. They would remain vigilant, prepared to face any future challenges that may arise on the red planet.

<center><font size="+2">Scotty tricks Marcus into getting on zombie ship</font></center>
Marcus of course was not dead. He had successfully escaped and was planning to return to Earth. Through his connections, he planned his escape from Mars. Marcus of course was a very high profile fugitive, and the people he used to plan his escape were also criminals. Many of them knew Scotty, and it didn't take long from the time that the word got out that Scotty was looking for Marcus to help him escape, that he was contacted to help with the escape. After all, Scotty had quite a reputation as a privateer. It made perfect sense to Marcus that Scotty would be his pilot. The escape plan included Marcus hiding out on a cargo ship in space until someone from Hy-Space picks him up and takes him back to Earth. 

So Scotty had been hired by Marcus to transport him from a hiding place on Mars to a cargo ship where he can hide out until a Hy-Space tanker bound for Earth picks him up and takes him to Earth. 

Scotty came up with a plan to trick Marcus and leave him stranded on CS-313, the zombie ship floating in space. Scotty arrived at Marcus' hiding place on Mars with his spaceship. Marcus got into the spaceship, and Scotty blasted off. Instead of heading towards Earth, Scotty headed towards CS-313. He knew that Marcus would be confused, but he didn't care. He was determined to get Marcus off of Mars and out of the way. As they approached CS-313, Scotty told Marcus that they needed to make a quick stop to refuel the spaceship. Marcus agreed, and Scotty docked his spaceship onto CS-313. As soon as Scotty's spaceship docked, Scotty told Marcus to get into the transfer bay and he would be right behind him. Once Marcus was securely on CS-313, Scotty undocked his ship and left. Marcus was trapped inside CS-313 with a group of zombies. 

Marcus was furious. He tried to break out of the spaceship, but it was no use. He was trapped. Scotty watched as CS-313 disappeared into the distance. He was relieved that Marcus was finally off of Mars and out of his hair.

Scotty was quite proud of how he had tricked Marcus. Scotty told Marcus that they needed to make a quick stop to refuel the spaceship. Marcus agreed, and Scotty docked his spaceship with CS-313. As soon as the spaceship docked, Scotty showed Marcus how to transfer over to CS-313. Scotty then closed the door, undocked his ship and left Marcus locked inside CS-313.

When Scotty pulled away Marcus was left stranded on CS-313.Scotty knew that Marcus would be suspicious of why they needed to refuel the spaceship so soon. However, he also knew that Marcus would be too eager to escape justice to question him too closely.

Scotty also knew that Marcus would try to break out of the spaceship and escape from CS-313. However, he also knew that CS-313 was a very secure ship. It was designed to contain zombies, and it was more than capable of containing Marcus. Scotty's plan was risky, but it worked perfectly. He tricked Marcus and left him stranded on CS-313, where he belonged.

Betty and Sophia meet up with him and chastise Scotty for helping Marcus escape. Scotty says nothing and just sits there with a smile on his face. Finally Betty gets in his face and shakes him and yells, "After all that we all have been through, how could you possibly help Marcus escape." 

Scotty stood up and said, "Zombies, I took him to the zombie ship." Betty and Dr. Dumas were very relieved. Marcus Mephitis was gone and they didn't have to worry about him any longer. That feeling only lasted about a week and then all hell broke loose. Around 10:30 Mars Central time, GNN broke into all broadcasting.

<center><font size="+2">GNN Urgent Update:</font></center>
Convicted crimes against humanity fugitive Marcus Mephitis has been located. Stay tuned as we broadcast his rescue and apprehension. Marcus was alive and he was on CS-313 the zombie ship. He had managed to work his way over to a safety pod much like the other two survivors of the zombie infestation had done. He had his own communication device with him and he used it to contact his security and they set out to rescue him. When Dr. Dumas and Betty hear of this they are mentally drained. After all they have been through and all the work they have done it appears Marcus will get free and he will have all of the 44th Triad killed.

The alert goes out to all 44th Triad coin holders. They all get on the network and talk for what they think is probably the last time.

The Marcus rescue mission is being broadcast on Earth, the Moon and Mars. Worlds are watching as the security rescue ship gets closer. The 44th Triad say their goodbyes and tell each other what a privilege it was working together. They all agree that they did their best and they would do it again. The rescue ship is now 10 Km away and making their final plans to board the zombie ship and save Marcus.

<center><font size="+2">Chad is still out there.</font></center>

<img src="Chapter10-c.gif" width="530" height="265" alt="" border="2">

Chad has successfully eluded the Hy-Space security by ducking into a wormhole that Dr. Dumas pointed out to him. No one has seen Chad for years but for Chad it seems to him that he has been in the wormhole at most 24 hours. This is what Chad is experiencing in the wormhole.

Chad's descent into the wormhole was an overwhelming sensory experience. The familiar world around him dissolved into a swirling vortex of colors, sounds, and sensations that defied description. He felt himself being stretched and compressed, pulled and pushed in all directions simultaneously. It was as if he were being torn apart and reassembled in a chaotic dance of matter and energy.

Time seemed to lose all meaning as Chad hurtled through the wormhole's infinite expanse. The passage could have been mere moments or an eternity; he had no way of knowing. The outside world seemed to fade away, replaced by an endless, shifting kaleidoscope of colors and patterns. It was a disorienting, yet strangely exhilarating experience.

As Chad journeyed deeper into the wormhole, he began to perceive other realities, fragments of worlds that existed beyond the confines of space and time. He saw glimpses of vibrant civilizations, sprawling cities of light, and alien landscapes teeming with life. He heard the echoes of ancient voices, the whispers of forgotten histories, and the melodies of celestial symphonies.

The wormhole seemed to be a conduit, a pathway that connected all of existence. It was a gateway to the infinite, a portal to the boundless possibilities of the universe. Chad felt a sense of awe and wonder, a realization that he was a part of something far greater than himself.

After what seemed like an eternity, the chaotic dance of colors and patterns began to subside. The wormhole's pull on his body lessened, and he felt a sense of weightlessness, of being suspended in an endless void. He opened his eyes, expecting to see the familiar surroundings but instead he thought he saw a ship. This was about the fourth or fifth time he had this vision of the same ship.

Was it real or was he hallucinating? At this point it really didn't matter because he was headed directly for it. He didn't know what would happen to him in either the real world or in some wormhole fantasy. He sensed that he was in trouble. So he got on his coms and tried to contact Dr. Dumas in desperation. This is how that played out. 

Out of nowhere they hear over the coms. "Hello! Dr. Dumas can you hear me?" Dr. Dumas says, "Yes I can hear you. Who is this?" The reply comes back, "This is Chad." That transmission surprised everyone in the 44th Triad. Dr. Dumas replied, "Chad, you have been missing and presumed dead for eleven years." Chad replied, "Dr., you must be mistaken. I have only been gone for a few days." Chad went on to explain what he had been doing since he escaped from the moon. Chad then went on to say how he believed he was finally going to make it out of the wormhole. There was sheer joy in his voice when he shouted, "I am going to make it. I can see the end. But wait. Oh no, what is that?"

On the screen they watch as the zombie ship rescue is being played out. A wormhole opens less than 100 meters from the middle of the ship. The view of the wormhole is partially blocked by CS-313 because the feed is being taken from the rescue ship and Chad's small craft is on the other side of CS-313. They watch in horror and relief as Chad P. Nervig's craft slams into the CS-313 zombie ship and they both erupt into a huge fireball.

Scotty raced towards the area where CS-313 was floating. He was determined to do something to try to stop Marcus because he was responsible for Marcus being on CS-313 in the first place. Scotty was coming from a different angle than the rescue ship and he could clearly see what was happening with the wormhole. He saw the opportunity to both save Chad and still eliminate both the zombies and Marcus at the same time. So he got on his coms and said, "Chad, this is Scotty. You have one shot at this if you want to stay alive. Press the third green button on the right side of the yoke right now." There was no reply and then the craft ran into CS-313 and a huge fireball erupted. Because of the blast he really couldn't tell what had just happened to Chad. Scotty headed to where he thought Chad would end up. Sure enough, about one kilometer from the exploding crafts was Chad. He was unconscious, floating safely in space in his emergency ejection pod.

Scotty gets on the secure 44th Triad coms and says. Chad looks like he survived. Anyone want me to pick him up or should I just let him float away? Scotty wasn't kidding. He had several run-ins with Chad over the years and he didn't care either way.

Dr. Dumas came on the coms and said, "Go reel him in Scotty, I need to debrief him about his wormhole experience." Scotty said "Roger that," and went off to bring him in.

Narrator: That is all she told me so far. If there is more to the story that Betty wants to tell me, you will be the first to know.
