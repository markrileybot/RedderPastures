Grace Roseberg already had quite a reputation on Earth as an environmentalist. She had participated in many protests, symposiums, studies and civil disobedience, all in the hope of saving planet Earth. Her last act of civil disobedience closed the port of Rotterdam for six months. Rotterdam is one of the largest fuel hubs in the world. Through her and her colleagues' actions, they effectively shut down fuel going through Rotterdam for the winter of 2050. 

For this she was convicted of a host of crimes, and was being sued for billions of dollars for loss of revenue. Through her hard work, she had established herself as the leading environmentalist on Earth, with over a billion followers. To avoid going to jail and being bankrupt for the rest of her life, Grace cut a deal with the world court in Hague.  For all practical purposes she was banished to Mars for twenty years. By the middle of 2051 Grace Roseberg landed on Mars and immediately went to work doing an environmental study on Mars. Because of her reputation and dedication to environmental issues, she quickly established herself as an environmental leader on Mars. 

Her work in that position and her reputation for honesty, openness and ability made her a logical candidate for the first Governor General on Mars. In November of 2054 she found herself in a tight race for Governor General going against Marcus Mephitis and his big money candidate John Worm. John Worm was the CEO of Hy-Space and had been a loyal Hy-space employee for the last thirty years. He was totally loyal to Marcus Mephitis and would find a way to rubber stamp any and all initiatives that Marcus would propose.  

After a very hard fought race, election day finally arrived. The polls said the race was too close to call because it was within the allowed margin of error. So Grace and her staff assembled in the habitat open area and watched the election returns as they came in. Grace was notified when the election results were finally in. Grace Roseberg couldn't believe it. She had defeated John Worm, the industrialists' backed lackey, by a narrow margin. It was a come-from-behind victory that no one had expected. 

Grace kept her message direct and simple. She campaigned on a platform of sustainability and social justice. She had faced an uphill battle against Worm, who was backed by the wealthy and powerful interests who wanted to exploit Mars for its resources. But Grace's message had resonated with the people of Mars. They were tired of being treated as second-class citizens by Earth, and they were ready for a change. Grace promised to be a Governor General who would represent all of the people of Mars, not just the wealthy and powerful. She had very specific plans, her proposals for affordable water, oxygen, health care and radiation shielding were real and workable. Making these basic necessities available at an affordable price for the inhabitants of Mars gave them more autonomy from Earth and its brand of politics.  

When the election results were made public she was asked to give a speech. The first thing she did was thank all of the people who put in the hard work to make this victory possible. Then she began to speak about her vision for Mars. "I believe that Mars can be a sustainable planet," she said. "We can live here in harmony with the environment, and we can create a prosperous future for ourselves and our children." She talked about her plans to invest in renewable energy, develop sustainable agriculture, and protect the Martian environment. She also talked about her commitment to equality and justice for all Martians. "I know that we can achieve great things together," she said. "I am excited to start working with you to build a better Mars." Grace Roseberg knew that she had the support of the people. She was ready to lead Mars into a new era of prosperity and sustainability.  Within the first week of office, Grace had her aides draw up an environmental constitution for Mars.

Grace Roseberg, the newly elected Governor General of Mars, made her first televised address to all of the planet's inhabitants.  What follows is the basic points of her speech. 

"We all know that Mars is a fragile planet," she said. "We must take care of it, if we want to survive here. That's why I have drafted a proposal for Mars' first  environmental constitution."

The audience listened attentively as Grace Roseberg outlined her plan. She proposed that the constitution would guarantee the right to a clean and healthy environment for all Martians. It would also establish a set of principles for environmental protection.

"This constitution is not just about protecting the environment," she said. "It's also about protecting our future. We need to make sure that Mars is a sustainable planet for generations to come."

The next morning, the results of the polls were quite favorable in support of Grace Roseberg's proposal. They knew that this was an important step in ensuring the future of Mars.

The Martian Parliament voted unanimously to approve the environmental constitution. Grace Roseberg signed the document into law, and Mars took a step forward in its journey to become a sustainable planet.

Grace addressed some very specific Martian issues such as the severe dust storms that were quite frequent on the planet, the scarcity of water, radiation threats, terraforming, and the risk of climate change. Most of these were also issues on Earth in one form or the other, but here Grace was able to address them directly. Not everyone supported the Environmental Constitution. Marcus Mephitis was a quite outspoken opponent of it. Grace knew that she had to deliver on her promises, or she would not make it through the next election cycle. 

One of the first issues that she addressed was water protection and availability. In August of 2023, NASA reported that it had an orbiting spacecraft equipped with enhanced lenses that spotted and recorded an ice flow on the surface of Mars. Over the next thirty or so years, research has determined the origin of the ice flows.

In simple terms, massive amounts of ice are trapped under the surface of Mars' crust. In a process similar to volcanoes on Earth, pressure builds underneath large areas of ice and it is pushed to the surface. Then gravity takes over. The ice flows downhill until it eventually melts and dissipates into the atmosphere.

Now in the 2050's the office of Grace Roseberg has developed protocols to detect tremors on Mars and predict where the ice flows will erupt on the surface.

Grace's office has also developed a process to herd the ice flows into areas where they can be melted, collected and stored. Grace actually started a new industry on Mars, called ice herding. 


<b><center><font size="+1">Proposal to harvest ice flows 
to capture water and oxygen on Mars</font></center>
<center><font size="+1">Submitted by Grace Roseberg and Hy-Space</font></center></b>
Water and oxygen are essential for life as we know it. However, these resources are scarce on Mars. The atmosphere is very thin and contains only 0.1% oxygen, and the surface is mostly dry and dusty.

One potential source of water and oxygen on Mars are the ice flows. Ice flows are large bodies of ice that move slowly across the Martian surface. They are thought to be formed when ice from the Martian polar ice cap melt and flow downhill and when pressure from Mars core forces them to the surface, much like lava flows from volcanoes. 

Ice herding on Mars is a dangerous and costly process. The ice flows are often massive, and they can move erratically. If there is even a mild earthquake during an ice herding event, it can cause the ice to break up and send large chunks flying through the air. This can damage equipment and injure or kill personnel.

One day, a team of ice herders was working on Mars when a mild earthquake struck. The ice flow they were herding broke up, and a large chunk of ice flew through the air and struck a nearby excavator. The excavator was destroyed, and the operator was killed.

This accident was a tragic reminder of the dangers of ice herding on Mars. It is a process that must be carried out with the utmost caution. 

Grace and Hy-Space have developed a proposal to harvest ice flows in order to capture water and oxygen on Mars. The proposal outlines a three-step process:


<b><font size="+1">Step one. </font></b>

Identify and track the ice flows. This can be done using satellite imagery and radar data.


<b><font size="+1">Step two. </font></b>

Harvest the ice flows. Once an ice flow has been identified and tracked, it can be harvested. One method is to use a robotic harvester to collect the ice. Another  method is to use a laser to melt the ice and then collect the water vapor.


<b><font size="+1">Step three. </font></b> 

Once the ice has been harvested, process the ice to extract water and oxygen. This can be done using electrolysis or reverse osmosis.


<b><font size="+1">Benefits:</font></b>

It is a sustainable way to produce water and oxygen on Mars.

It does not require any external energy sources.

It can be scaled up to produce large quantities of water and oxygen.

It does not produce any harmful emissions.


<b><font size="+1">Implementation:</font></b>

One possible approach is to use a fleet of robotic harvesters to collect the ice. The harvesters could be equipped with solar panels to provide power, and they could be controlled remotely from Earth.

Another possible approach is to use a laser to melt the ice and then collect the water vapor. The laser could be mounted on a spacecraft or on a rover.


<b><font size="+1">Conclusion:</font></b>

The proposed method of harvesting ice flows to capture water and oxygen on Mars is a viable and sustainable way to produce these essential resources on the Red Planet. It has the potential to revolutionize our ability to explore and colonize Mars.

Grace also addressed terraforming, where she had long range plans to slowly change Mars' environment to make it more suitable for Earthlings. She planned on doing this by utilizing many of the clean environmental principles that she had worked so hard for on Earth. 

She laid out her plans in a major address that was broadcast live on Mars and Earth. She started out by saying, "We all know that Mars is a harsh planet, but I believe that we can make it habitable for humans. We can do this through sustainable terraforming."

She explained that sustainable terraforming is a process of transforming Mars into a more Earth-like environment without causing further damage to the planet. She said that this would require a careful balance of technology and environmental protection.

"We need to use technology to help us," she said. "But we also need to be careful not to damage the Martian environment. We need to work with nature, not against it."

Like on Earth, big businesses did not like the extra burden of being responsible for their manufacturing methods, especially having to be responsible for the waste it produced. They preferred to have designated waste areas and landfills where they could dump their hazardous materials at little or no cost. These were some of the largest corporations on Earth and they were well funded. They were sure to be formidable adversaries. 

Grace had seen the cities of Earth and witnessed the homeless and people living in substandard housing. She addressed these issues first with another major speech and then a set of proposals to the legislature. In her speech, Grace said; "We all know that Mars is a harsh environment, but we also know that humans can live there. We just need to make sure that their homes are safe and healthy."

She explained that the minimum housing standards would ensure that all Martians had access to adequate shelter, water, proper radiation shielding and sanitation. They would also include provisions for safety and security, as well as for environmental protection.

"These standards are not just about providing basic necessities," she said. "They're also about creating a sense of community and belonging. We want everyone on Mars to feel at home."


<b><center><font size="+1">Proposed minimum housing standards.</font></center></b> 
The home must be structurally sound and be able to withstand the Martian environment, specifically its dust storms. On this subject she recognized many challenges, specifically the lack of materials, the harsh climate, and the potential for dust storms. 

Exploit non-traditional dwelling ideas. Include inflatable habitats, underground bunkers, and biodomes. 

Follow established ventilation and insulation guidelines to maintain a comfortable temperature.

Include a reliable source of water and sanitation facilities.

Location was key. It must be located in a safe area that is not prone to dust storms or other hazards.

It must meet the minimum radiation detection and shielding standards.


<b><center><font size="+1">Grace, governor of Mars has an early term crisis: 
the cost of oxygen.</font></center></b>
As the governor of Mars, everyday is busy, but Grace's phone and social media had been blowing up for the last two days. People of Mars were outraged at Marcus' announcement that the price of oxygen was going to double at the beginning of the year. The people were demanding change and answers to why Marcus Mephitis' companies were allowed to become the sole providers of oxygen on Mars.

It wasn't like this in the beginning of colonization. Actually oxygen was free and provided by the government until Marcus was able through lobbying, bribery and intimidation to have oxygen privatized. It was argued that privatization of oxygen would bring more competition and provide economies of scale.

This was all true in the beginning of privatization. Multiple vendors and payment plans were available and the reliable flow of oxygen was delivered at a nominal fee. Then slowly over time Marcus bought out or forced out his competitors until he became the sole provider. Even then prices climbed slowly. But now Marcus announced that prices would be doubled and delinquent accounts would be turned off.

Grace knew there had to be a reasonable solution to Marcus' greed. She called her friend Betty Ballena at GNN and asked for help in researching a solution. Betty assured Grace that she would get a research team right on it. 

Betty also contacted Dr. Dumas and explained to her that this was also a great 44th Triad issue because if they came up with a cost effective alternative to Marcus, it would weaken his strangle hold on Mars.

Dr. Dumas' eyes sparkled with excitement as she scanned the article in Smithsonian magazine, outlining a revolutionary method for producing oxygen from Mars' own resources using an AI-powered chemist. This groundbreaking technology held the potential to revolutionize space exploration, enabling human settlements on Mars to thrive, without relying on oxygen shipments from Earth.

Determined to bring this technology to life, Dr. Dumas assembled a team of brilliant scientists and engineers, their minds buzzing with the possibilities. They embarked on a mission to replicate the AI chemist's process, adapting it to the unique conditions of Mars and scaling it up to meet the demands of a growing Martian population.

The first step was to gather the necessary materials, which were abundant on Mars: water ice, carbon dioxide, and Martian rocks containing the required catalysts. The AI chemist, a sophisticated neural network trained on a vast dataset of chemical reactions, would then guide the team in optimizing the process, maximizing the yield of oxygen while minimizing energy consumption.

The team set up a pilot plant in a simulated Martian environment, carefully replicating the atmospheric pressure and temperature conditions of the Red Planet. They meticulously followed the AI chemist's instructions, feeding it real-time data from the plant's sensors. The AI chemist analyzed the data, making adjustments to the process parameters as needed.

After months of fine-tuning and optimization, the pilot plant was producing oxygen at an impressive rate, exceeding even the AI chemist's initial estimates. This success marked a significant milestone, paving the way for larger-scale production on Mars.

With the feasibility of the process proven, Dr. Dumas and her team began designing a full-scale oxygen production facility. They incorporated the AI chemist's expertise into the design, creating a self-learning system that could adapt to changing conditions and optimize its performance over time.

The oxygen production facility was constructed using cutting-edge robotics and automated systems, minimizing the need for human intervention. This was crucial for operating the facility on Mars, where the harsh environment and limited resources posed challenges to traditional manufacturing methods.

Once the facility was operational, it seamlessly integrated with the Martian colony's infrastructure, providing a continuous supply of oxygen to support the growing population. The AI chemist, constantly monitoring and optimizing the process, ensured that the facility operated at peak efficiency, maximizing the utilization of Mars' limited resources.

Dr. Dumas' vision had become a reality. Oxygen was now being produced on Mars from Mars materials, a testament to human ingenuity and the power of artificial intelligence. This breakthrough technology paved the way for a self-sustaining human presence on Mars, opening up a new era of exploration and discovery.

Dr. Dumas' vision for low cost reliable oxygen for all Martians has been made a reality. Grace Roseberg is given the task of starting a company to manage the whole process. She named the company Pandora Solutions.

Pandora Solutions will be environmentally friendly using locally sourced renewable solutions to solve everyday Mars problems. This is Grace's speech to announce the availability of cheaper reliable oxygen and the roll out of Pandora Solutions,


<b><center><font size="+1">Grace Roseberg's oxygen speech</font></center></b>
<img src="Chapter06-b.gif" width="538" height="264" alt="" border="2">

Distinguished guests, fellow Martians, and esteemed colleagues, today, we stand on the precipice of a remarkable transformation, a moment where innovation and sustainability converge to shape the future of our Martian home. I stand before you today to unveil a groundbreaking advancement that will revolutionize our lives on Mars: the availability of affordable, reliable oxygen for all Martians.

For years, the production of oxygen on Mars has been a complex and costly endeavor, relying heavily on imported resources and energy-intensive processes. This has constrained our ability to fully realize the potential of Mars, limiting our growth and development.

But today, we break free from those limitations. Thanks to the visionary work of Pandora Solutions scientists and their support team, we have unlocked a revolutionary method for producing oxygen from Mars' own resources, utilizing locally sourced materials and renewable energy sources. This breakthrough not only ensures a sustainable supply of oxygen for our growing Martian community but also paves the way for a more environmentally conscious and cost-effective approach to life on Mars.

To usher in this new era, I am proud to announce the creation of Pandora Solutions, a company dedicated to managing the entire oxygen production process and providing reliable oxygen access to every Martian. Pandora Solutions will be a beacon of environmental responsibility, embracing sustainable practices and utilizing locally sourced renewable solutions to address everyday challenges on Mars.

As we embark on this journey together, I envision a future where oxygen is not a luxury but a fundamental right, accessible to all Martians regardless of their background or location. I envision a future where our Martian cities thrive, powered by clean energy and fueled by innovation. And I envision a future where Mars becomes a model of sustainable living, setting a new standard for humanity's relationship with its environment.

The availability of affordable, reliable oxygen marks a turning point in our Martian history. It is a testament to our ingenuity, our resilience, and our unwavering commitment to building a thriving future for ourselves and for generations to come.

With Pandora Solutions leading the way, we are poised to transform Mars into a haven of innovation, sustainability, and prosperity. Together, we will create a Martian society that is not only self-sustaining but also a beacon of hope for the future of humanity.

Grace Roseberg was invited to do a study on Mars atmosphere by a UN council. She was commissioned to look at Mars' temperatures and if they were raising or lowering. Next she was to check if any water was remaining stable in the atmosphere and finally to look for evidence that the atmosphere was actually thickening.

One of the alarming items that Grace found was a series of large empty reservoirs had been built around the North and South Poles. This was a red flag for Grace because there were no known bodies of water on Mars. Grace turned this information over to Betty to see if Betty could find out why they were built, who built them, and what they intended to do with them.

Betty and Sophia found evidence that Marcus planned to set off a series of nuclear blasts over the poles. This would melt the polar ice caps and the reservoirs were placed to collect the resulting runoff. Marcus then planned to have a monopoly on non-imported water. This would be worth billions.


<b><center><font size="+1">Marcus' plan to monopolize Martian water:</font></center></b>
Space Force Mars has contracted with Hy-Space to place five weather and radiation detection satellites in orbit above both the North and South Poles. Since geosynchronous orbit is not possible over the poles, the satellites were placed in highly elliptical orbits with one endpoint near the North or South Pole. This path would result in long periods spent near the pole, but the satellites wouldn't remain constantly overhead. The satellites would remain in close proximity to the poles, approximately fifty percent of the time. This was plenty of time to accomplish Marcus' mission. 

From the Space Force Mars standpoint this mission was routine. The contract called for two Space Force rockets to deliver the payload. Right on schedule, two Space Force rockets were on the launch pads ready for lift off. Their rockets were already firing in a pre-flight condition as the countdown continued. As more checkpoints were met, more smoke poured out of the engines.

After the craft had exited Mars atmosphere, they continued to their designated release coordinates. Rocket one went north and rocket two went south. Each rocket released their satellite payloads without incident. By the time the two rockets returned to the Space Force launch pad, Hy-Space verified that ten fully functional satellites were in place. 

About thirty days after that, Space Force Mars has another contracted service with Hy-Space. The contract calls for the Space Force to provide two ships and appropriate crew to dock with two Hy-Space tanker ships and take on ten, enhanced satellite pods, that had been warehoused at Refueling Station 5. 

The final countdown begins, all systems are go, and the engines start to roar. As the rockets slowly lift above ground they are constantly accelerating. They quickly turn into two trails of smoke before they disappear from sight.

They head off to the rendezvous point with Hy-Space tankers HST-05 and HST-07. Once they meet and dock, four astronauts exit their respective command modules and perform space walks to transfer the enhanced satellite pods from the Hy-Space tankers to the Space Force ships. After the transfer of cargo is complete, the Hy-Space tankers return to their base and the Space Force ships continue with the next step of their mission.    


<b><center><font size="+1">Satellite Pods over the polar ice caps</font></center></b>
<img src="Chapter06-c.gif" width="540" height="265" alt="" border="2">

The Space Force astronauts reach their designated rendezvous point by the North Pole. They activate the ship's controllable arms and lock on to the nearest satellite. At the same time the Space Force astronauts by the South Pole mimic the same operation.

The Space Force ship's cargo doors open, and a sleek set of pods slowly emerge. The enhanced satellite pods are sleek, silver cylinders, but there doesn't seem to be any cameras, large solar panel arrays, or any other typical satellite artifacts.

2nd Lt Walsh and Maj French immediately give each other odd looks. They have transferred satellite pods many times in their careers. The containers that they are transferring don't look like anything resembling what they have loaded before  on satellites. Actually they look like some form of munition. They both came from the Air Force as fighter pilots and they were very aware of the difference between satellites and munitions.

One by one, the Space Force astronauts attach a sleek silver pod to each Hy-Space satellite, until they have attached a pod to each of the ten satellites. Once the pods are successfully transferred to the Hy-Space satellites,  the Space Force ships head off to their home base on Mars. 

On the trip back to base, Walsh and French once again discuss their odd mission. "Hey Walsh, yeah Frenchie. Are you thinking what I'm thinking about this mission? I sure am Frenchie, there is no possible way in hell that we just deployed satellites. I agree with you Walsh, this whole mission is total bullshit. We just placed five munitions, probably nuclear warheads above the North Pole of Mars and I bet a dollar to a do-nut that the other crew just did the same at the South Pole." 

Walsh said to Frenchie, "this is definitely not right, but I don't know who to tell or even how to find out what the hell is going on." Frenchie says, "I know a guy who has a pulse on all shady deals going on up here. If anyone can figure this out, my friend Scotty can."


<b><center><font size="+1">44th Triad is notified and comes up with a plan</font></center></b>
So Frenchie sets up a meeting with Scotty on RFS-5. He brings Walsh along with him. RFS-5 has a recreational facility connected to it, and way in the back is a little bar called, the Little Alien named after the Little Ale Inn Restaurant Bar and Motel by Area 51.

Scotty brings Captain Russell and Norman Narval. They all served together back in 2044 and pretty much trust each other. After several drinks and some fairly decent food, Frenchie tells the rest of the group what he and Walsh observed on their last mission. Captain Russell goes into a backroom for a couple of minutes to talk to Betty Ballena over a secure line. Betty says she will get back with him in an hour because she needs to check her sources to try to see what might be going on. 

Betty sent an encoded message to Dr. Dumas who is able to search through Marcus' and Hy-Space corporate files. What she discovers is project Smeltet Is. Smeltet Is, translates in Norwegian, to melted ice. She digs deeper and discovers that Melted Ice is a plan to melt the Mars polar ice caps, collect the water in reservoirs that are already built, and then sell the water on Mars at an exorbitant price. The thing is, the target price will be cheaper than bringing water in from Earth or producing water on Mars through other methods. Dr. Dumas also finds out that Hy-Space is hiding the possible radiation contamination of that water because of the method that is going to be used to melt the ice caps. 

Hy-Space plans to detonate five large nuclear bombs over each polar ice cap at a close enough range to melt the ice. The detonation countdown has already been set and the bombs will go off in seventy-two hours. 

With oversight from Dr. Dumas, Grace Roseberg, and Betty Ballena, Captain Russell assembled a crew to carry out a mission to remove the nuclear armed satellites from the vicinity of the poles. As usual, he has Scotty obtain the ten craft to execute the mission. The plan is to secure the satellites and pull them far enough into space that Mars will not be affected by the blasts. A craft will be assigned to each satellite and will be pulled away in a different direction. This is being done so the satellites don't accidentally collide and detonate the nukes.

Each squad of five will approach the satellites in a tight formation, coming in slowly so that it appears that some space junk is floating into the vicinity of the armed satellites, not close enough to raise alarm of a possible collision. Then they are to break out of formation and dash toward their pre-designated satellite, attach and pull it off into space. 

Scotty and Norman are assigned as the designated leaders for this mission. Scotty's squadron will remove the satellites from above the North Pole, and Norman's squadron will remove the satellites from above the South Pole. Each craft has a pilot, navigator and mission specialist. The mission specialist must venture outside the craft, disable the target satellite's thrusters, attach a tow line and return to the original craft within one hour. Any longer than that will give Space Force enough time to determine what is going on and either send fighters to intercept them, or more likely, send missiles to detonate the satellites and their nuclear payload. It doesn't matter if the Space Force is aware of what has been loaded onto their satellites. Their protocol is to blow up satellites before hostile forces capture them. This is to protect secret proprietary components of the satellites. 

The mission is on schedule and going according to plan. All mission specialists are outside their craft and engaged with their appointed satellites. The astronauts have been working on the satellites for several minutes. They have finally managed to attach a grappler to the satellites. However, as they are about to return to their respective crafts, a small and undetected set of asteroids hit two of the satellites and knocked them off balance. The two grappler hooks actually detached from the satellites, and two tow lines and the astronauts are released into space.

The astronauts are now floating helplessly in space. The satellites have their thrusters inoperable, the astronauts are not tethered to anything and are floating free in space. This is all happening on the North Pole side. Scotty asks Norman to report what is going on at the South Pole. Norman reports that they have secured all tow lines and disabled all five satellites. Scotty tells Norman to direct his squadron to pull away and execute the second part of the mission which is to pull the satellites with their nukes into deep space away from Mars. 

Scotty also orders two of the craft in his squadron who have their satellites tethered and their mission specialists back on board to leave the area and like the Southern squadron, execute the second half of the mission which is to pull the satellites with their nukes into deep space away from Mars.

The Northern squadron has now been over the target area for over forty-five minutes and Space Force Mission Control is aware of Scotty's un-authorized presence. They contact him and ask him to identify himself. Scotty remains silent and starts thinking about an escape plan. The mission has contingency plans but just not one to cover this scenario. 

The current situation is two satellites are disabled and not tethered to anything and two mission specialists are also out there floating in space. Scotty has a tethered satellite connected to his craft and a complete crew. Scotty has craft three in his squadron pull alongside his craft and they transfer their tethered satellite over to craft three. They tie the second satellite behind the first one. It looked much like the beginnings of a train. He also has his crew transfer to the other ships that are still in the area. Scotty orders the pilot of craft four to retrieve the two free floating specialists and to return to base on RFS-5 with them. In the meantime, the Space Force has informed Scotty that if he doesn't identify himself in the next fifteen minutes they are going to open fire on him with missiles. 

Master Sergeant Jones is at his post doing his usual duty, monitoring all satellites orbiting Mars. It is boring tedious work that is only made possible by three pots of coffee a day and a couple of Red Bulls on particularly boring days or days he has a hangover which are only days that end in Y. He gets an alert that space junk is drifting towards the satellites over the ice cap at the North Pole. It definitely has his attention because what it is not, another "same shit different day" (SSDD). This is an anomaly that he can actually track and write a report about. 

Five minutes later he gets another alert, space junk is drifting towards the satellites over the ice cap at the South Pole. Coincidence or not, this really has his attention and he focuses on both areas. At exactly the same time both areas of space junk split apart into five separate ships and speed toward the satellites. MSG Jones sounds the alert by contacting his officer of the watch, 2nd Lt Patel. Patel is the kind of officer who does everything by the book. Over Jones' protest he makes Jones go through the protocol of identifying hostile actions. Jones had to go through the OLIDRD protocol.

<b><font size="+1">Observation</font></b> - look for an anomaly that appears to be out of place.

<b><font size="+1">Location</font></b> - paint the area with space radar and pinpoint the exact location on the space grid map.

<b><font size="+1">Identification</font></b> - Try to contact the craft on standard communication channels.

<b><font size="+1">Determination</font></b> - based on reply or no reply, make a determination if the craft is friend or foe. 
 
<b><font size="+1">Resolution</font></b> - if friend, record the incident for follow up, if foe, make proper contact and receive clearance to take action.

<b><font size="+1">Destruction</font></b> - once clearance is obtained destroy unfriendly craft.

By the time Jones went through the <b>OLIDRD</b> protocol, the crafts and satellites at the South Pole were out of range and out of sight. The crafts at the North Pole were still in play. 2nd Lt Patel passed the report up the chain to Col Bird. Col Bird acknowledged and accepted it and passed it up to Brig Gen Markum. Brig Gen Markum gave the destroy order. 

When the destroy order was finally received by MSG Jones, there were only two satellites and one craft within range. He fired the missile immediately. MSG Jones knew that he was definitely going to hit something. He tracked the missile to the satellites and craft that was towing them and recorded a huge explosion. It was much larger than expected and he felt assured that the secondary explosion had eradicated both satellites and the tow craft. MSG Jones reported the results up the chain and was congratulated on a job well done.

Scotty really wasn't a safe distance from the two satellites when they blew up, but yet he made it back to rendezvous point first. There is more to that story, but for now everyone was meeting at the rendezvous point to make sure everyone was safe, and they still needed to be debriefed by Captain Russell and Betty Ballena. 

The ten astronaut pilots docked their craft to RFS-5 one by one as they arrived. Oddly enough Scotty was the first to arrive. All of them looked exhausted but relieved. They had just completed a clandestine mission, to hurl Space Force satellites, armed with Hy-Space nuclear weapons, into outer space where they self-destructed. This was something punishable by a very long jail sentence.
 
They made their way to the bar at the rendezvous point, where they were greeted by Captain Russell and Betty Ballena. The astronauts ordered drinks and began to celebrate their safe return.

"I can't believe we're all here," said one of the astronauts. "I thought for sure we were going to die." "Me too," said another. "But we made it." The astronauts raised their glasses in a toast. "To survival," they said.

They spent the next few hours being debriefed by Captain Russell and Betty. They were given strict instructions. They had two hours to drink, eat and talk about their mission, but only amongst themselves. They relived the tense moments when they thought they might not make it, and they shared their stories of courage and determination. When that time was over they all had to sign Non Disclosure agreements and promise to never tell anyone what they had done. They said their goodbyes and all went their separate ways. They all knew that this was probably the last time that they would see each other. This had been a mission none of them would ever forget. A time when they came together as a team and faced their fears. A time when they proved that anything is possible if you never give up.

Scotty should have been blown up with the satellites that he was towing and he knew it. To this day only two people know why he wasn't. The two people are Dr. Dumas and Scotty. When Scotty saw on his screen that the Space Force missile closure rate would not give him enough clearance to escape the nuclear blast that would follow, Scotty lowered his head and smiled and thought to himself, well this has been one hell of a run and there is nothing better than going out with a bang. 

That feeling lasted about twenty seconds and then over the coms Scotty heard, "Scotty you know who this is. It is your friend from the box." Scotty felt like an electric shock had just gone through him. He knew immediately Dr. Dumas was going to tell him something in the hopes of saving him. She then barked out coordinates and a heading. Without flinching, Scotty released the tow line, and  made an almost ninety degree right bank and punched in the coordinates. In ten more seconds he blacked out and he regained consciousness within sight of RFS-5. He calmly approached RFS-5, docked and headed to the bar and had himself a beer. He later learned from Dr. Dumas that she had directed him through a wormhole just in time to miss the blast and it brought him to safety. She knew it was risky but knew that Scotty was out of options.  

The next day, the ten mission pilots went their separate ways. Some went to Mars, some returned to Earth, two went to the Moon and another one went to work at RFS-3 as a loadmaster. They knew that they would never take life for granted again.

When Marcus and the Hy-Space executives were briefed on this action, they were furious. This had completely ruined their plan to hijack the water supply on Mars. They contacted their spin doctors and started a propaganda campaign that this was a great project that was sabotaged by Dr. Grace Roseberg. The spin doctors placed all of the blame on Roseberg. They put forth the plan that Marcus and Hy-Space was going to collect the water and give it freely to the people of Mars but now that Roseberg ruined everything, the people of Mars would have to pay an exorbitant amount to bring water to Mars.
